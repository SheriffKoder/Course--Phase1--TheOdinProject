*ability to put together a content-managed website.
*proof that I could actually deliver on a CMS soon after the interview.

*CRUD application with PHP/MySQL


I taught myself about [HTTP][http-rfc], managing complexity and version control. 
I invested in touch-typing, learned how to use vim to an intermediate level 
and received a harsh introduction to the world of web application security.

extend yourself


received an offer for a permanent full-time role for a salary of £21,000 per annum 
(roughly $34,000 USD). At the time I knew this wasn't a great salary.
that is 87E$

next job
salary stayed in the £20k-£30k ($34k-$48k) range. work and doing freelance work

next job after a year and a half
two offers in hand. Both were at £38k ($61k)

recruiter had submitted me for a position as a "senior" developer. 
At this stage I had roughly two years of experience developing web professionally, 
and would never have had the confidence to apply as a senior developer on my own.


////Senior interview:
grilled on every skill listed on my CV. In each instance I was questioned 
until I had to say "I don't know, but I'd search the documentation/rfc/google 
for x to find out".

I was given mock scenarios for high-scalability web applications, asked 
to "explain polymorphism without reference to animals or shapes

and had to talk through a code review with developers from the team, 
spotting badly chosen algorithms, subtle errors and bad coding style with as 
much politeness as I could muster.
topics like composition over inheritance

I was invited back for a second interview in a few days where 
I was to give a presentation on a technical topic of my choosing 
(out of a list of possible options). I went with hash tables as 
I remembered a thing or two about them from university and could piece 
together the rest from wikipedia.


I made it clear that the presentation would very much be a condensed version 
of the wikipedia article before starting, and then spoke for around ten minutes 
on the topic. After the presentation I was again grilled, this time on favorable 
properties of hashing functions, common problems, possible solutions etc. 
I had done my research and was prepared for the initial barrage, 
but it wasn't long before my knowledge on the subject ran dry.


I again went home, this time quite sure that I wouldn't get the offer from Bravo. 
I didn't have enough experience to be a "senior" developer and I felt my knowledge 
bottomed out in the interview far too often.

Around a week later, the recruiter got back to me to let me know that Bravo 
wanted to bring me on as a senior developer for £44,000 per annum ($70k), 
more than double the salary I started on as a web developer only two years ago.
180k/m, 2.1m/y

It was such a huge jump for me that I felt like there was some catch, 
some downside that I had missed because I didn't quite deserve this level of 
compensation just yet.

I accepted the offer. Working at Bravo was by far the hardest and most educational 
technical job I've yet to experience. Among other things, we had:


A polyglot codebase (PHP/ActionScript for the web front-end, Java for back-end services)


My job had been to have my assumptions questioned, hard, by people who 
were a lot smarter than me.
After that, not only was I capable of having strong technical opinions, 
I was able to articulate them clearly.
while working started to feel a lot more confident in my abilities by the end of my time there.


//////Finding your first few web developer jobs
Over the course of my career I've applied to more openings, 
attended more interviews and turned down more offers than I can honestly remember. 

1. Start building assets that make you more hirable
2. Collect information on a large number of job openings to get a feel for the market
3. Prioritize the leads based on a set of criteria, personal to you
4. Apply to the most attractive leads based on your criteria with a CV, and covering letter.
5. Prepare for and give a good interview when invited
6. Only make a decision when you have at least three offers in hand.


just make sure you are accepting what you would mostly get at this point
not take it on faith from someone who benefits from you accepting a lower salary.


//////1. Build Advantages

Before you start the application process, 
you need to have a number of advantages


1) Social Proof. 
If you've been hired by three other companies in the past, 
have a string of testimonials and the battle scars to show for them, 
you become a lot easier to hire.

Building a network of professionals that can vouch for you not only 
makes you more valuable in the eyes of potential hirers, it also gives 
you a lot of confidence going into an interview.

Actionable advice: Get hired as a web developer and spend a few years 
doing a good job of it. Failing that, attend local user groups and 
tech-scene events, meet people in real life and try to impart something 
of value when you do.




2) Technical Depth. 
I believe that anyone who works programming computers should 
"know what they don't know" about the entire stack

Actionable advice: Read about the job of programming and take steps 
to get better at it. Learn about OS fundamentals, object oriented design patterns, 
functional programming, network protocols, 
finite state automata, data structures + algorithms and whatever 
the hell else you can get your hands on.



3)Technical Skill
it does not matter what tool you use 
as long as you know those tools well

Also, learning to use a VCS (e.g. git) is a prerequisite for any programming job 
in the 21st century.

Actionable advice: Use deliberate practice to get better at building software. 
There's a difference between knowing the perfect recipe for a roast chicken and 
having the skill to debone one in sixty seconds. If there's any technical 
skill you can think of that you're worried about not having, chase it down, 
practice it and own it.

Some examples might be getting better at modifying code in your favorite 
text editor, learning how to set up and configure a web server by hand, 
doing non-trivial joins in SQL or improving your abilities at the 
terminal with coreutils.


4) A Web Presence
If I go to your personal homepage, is there an easy way for me to find about 
your expertise? Do you have a profile on LinkedIn that I can read through 
to find out about your experience and skillset? Can I at least get a 
hold of your CV? 
You don't need to be a prolific blogger

Actionable advice: Build a website that shows off you skills, 
experience and portfolio, making sure it links to other places on the 
internet where you can be found. This could be a single page with an intro, 
contact information and sections headed 'skills', 'experience', 'portfolio' 
and 'links'. Don't spend forever on this, just get that single page up, 
make it look half decent and move on.

5)Working Software, publicly available
Hirers just want to confirm that you can code at all. 
Make this easy for them by building things and putting the things you 
built where they can see them.


Actionable advice: Spend a little time brainstorming potential portfolio pieces, 
pick the most interesting project out of your list and build it. The smaller 
and easier to complete, the better. Once you've finished, make it available 
at a public URL and host the code on github. Repeat twice for best results.

None of these advantages are things that you can build overnight. 
They take consistent effort over the course of at least a month. 
Without them, it will be difficult to secure an interview.



//////2. Collect Leads

Using Highrise, a text file or some paper filing system, create a list of leads. 
For each lead list:

Name of the company if known
Contact information for sending an application
A URL to the job listing if applicable

Good sources for leads, in order of preference:
Your personal network
Direct Applications
Job Boards
Recruiters

for leads from your network
nicely worded email to everyone in your circle
informing them of your current situation
the kind of work you're looking for
and link to your personal homepage (where hirers can find out more about you)

To find out what companies are hiring technical staff, it's worth looking for 
places that already list companies that build software. Silicon Milk Roundabout, 
Techcrunch, YC Alumni, client lists of software consultancies or anywhere else 
software companies are listed will do the trick. For each list, 
visit the companies website, look for their 'jobs' section and add any 
potential leads to your list.

Authentic Jobs
Github Jobs
StackOverflow Jobs
Hacker Jobs UK
CWJobs

Try to resist the urge to apply straight away. 
At the moment the goal is to collect a large swathe of leads to get a 
feel for the technical employment market right now.


treat recruiters like any other lead, log the job spec and continue. 
Before working with recruiters on a real-life opening, 
I would strongly recommend reading Secrets of Power Negotiating by Roger Dawson. 
It lists in detail exactly the sort of tactics that recruiters will use 
when dealing with you. Best to go into any business with recruiters 
with your eyes wide open.






//////3. Qualify Leads: 
Make a list of criteria for prioritizing opportunities

When looking at a job prospect, different 
things are important to different people.

list of questions that I ask myself about a given lead to qualify it:

A) Are you likely to secure an offer? are you fit for the role?

B) Will your skills and knowledge progress (in the direction you want them to)?
If you want to level up as a developer, you won't be challenged if you're 
building content managed websites forever. Based on what the company does 
and the sort of technical tasks it will entail, will you have passion for the work?

C) Will the job pay you enough?
any job you apply to needs to pay you enough so that money isn't an issue for you.

D)Is the job secure enough?
 Do you want to be the first hire in an early stage startup? A new member of an established technical team?

E) Am I going to be productive with this company? 
Will they have some sort  of iterative development process or is 
it the same chaos that most companies that happen to need programmers 
find themselves in?


Add or remove questions as you see fit. Remote work may be an important factor 
for you if you don't live near a major city. You might prefer to work with 
many clients in a consultancy, or work on an in-house development team 
responsible for both new features and maintenance. You might have a 
preference for front-end over back-end work.

Based on your collection of leads you should have a good idea of the sort 
of jobs available to you in the current market, so you can adjust your 
criteria accordingly.

Your list doesn't need to be a iron-clad; we're just trying to figure out 
what's important to you in any potential job opening. When looking for a 
job it can be quite tempting to accept whatever offer comes your way. 
Knowing what's important to you before you even make an application 
should help you keep focused on your own priorities rather than 
those of the companies trying to hire you.

Once you have a good idea of what's important to you, take your shortlist 
of leads and remove any that have no chance of meeting your criteria.

You don't want to rule out too many leads, just the ones that are obviously 
not a good fit for you.

It can be difficult to assess suitability without having an in-person meeting, 
so be liberal in what you let through for now.



//////4. Make Applications

For each of your leads that have made it through your qualification stage, 
you're going to apply with a CV and a short email.

To begin, you'll need to put a CV together that highlights all the 
advantages you've built up. To reiterate, those include technical depth, 
technical skill, social proof and working software.

For social proof you might list some of the companies you've worked for 
and/or testimonials you've received from past colleagues. This could be 
for jobs that are non-technical if you have no relevant full-time experience.

For technical depth/skill you could highlight some of the technologies you've 
worked with and can reason about at different levels of abstraction. 
You'll should be able to talk confidently about anything you list here, 
and and demonstrate relevant skill in an interview.

For working software you should link to either a working installation of 
an application that you created or a code sample that you were responsible 
for. Make this easy to find and preview.

2-5 examples of each of the above will go a long way towards making your 
case to hirers selecting candidates for interview.

While the core content and stories of your CV should remain the same, 
it's worth customizing it to specific job descriptions. 
If you're applying for a job that will entail statistics 
and machine learning, you might choose a different set of sample projects 
than you would if you were applying for job building e-commerce websites.



You'll also need to write a brief covering email along with your CV, 
highlighting your suitability for the role.


If you're missing a major requirement listed in the job spec, ignoring 
it is the worst thing you can do. Your best shot at making up for any 
shortcomings is to address them directly and highlight your will and 
ability to learn fast and not be a burden on your future team. 
The covering letter is a good a place as any to do this.


an example below of the sort of covering letter 
I might send over as a fresh-faced newbie

/////////////
Hi Alice,

I'm Bob, a web developer currently available for full-time employment.

According to your company website, you're currently hiring web developers. Based on the information outlined there, I believe I would make a good addition to your team.

You might notice that I don't have any commercial experience, so I would be applying to this role as a junior developer. While I've never worked as a full-time web developer before, I'm proficient with many of the technologies listed in your requirements, have deployed working software and believe I would contribute value to your development team from day one.

Please find attached my CV with links to code samples and projects that demonstrate my abilities. Additionally, you can see my profile on github here: http://github.com/example-example-example

It would be great to meet for a chat at some point if you have any interest in taking this further.

Kind Regards,

-Bob, http://bobthewebdeveloper.example.com/
/////////////


Don't just copy this blindly and hope. Mention reasons why 
you're a good fit for the role/company
if you're not and you don't, then you should be and you should.


For each application, log the date that you applied in your lead filing system 
and be sure to follow up via email a set number of days later. 
My follow up schedule (assuming no response) is three days, 
one further week and an additional two further weeks before giving up on a lead. 
There are a million reasons why a potential hirer may forget to get back to you, 
so make it easy for them to remember. Follow up.


Take care with each application and make only three or four at a time. 
Applying to every one of your leads at the same time can be confusing 
for you and won't help you to make as good an impression as possible on each hirer. 
Wait a week before applying to more, and feel free to update your leads list 
based on new opportunities or information.

If they come back with a rejection, use it as an opportunity to learn. 
Being as courteous as humanly possible, ask them what their concerns were 
about your profile. For future applications, modify your covering letter 
copy to address any issues that they raise.






//////5. Interview Well
If your applications go well, with a bit of luck you should 
be invited to interview at least once.

If you've made it this far
you're most of the way to securing an offer. 

If they weren't interested in hiring you, 
they wouldn't invite you in for interview.

There are as many types of interview as there are companies that hire programmers. 

There are highly technical slogging matches, going through 
data structures and ERDs on whiteboards. 

There are entirely non-technical interviews that speak in very 
broad terms about your history and abilities.

They can be one-on-one, two-on-one or with a panel. 

You might have pre-interview programming challenges or multiple phone 
screens before you're even called in to interview.

With all this variation, it can be difficult to plan a general strategy 
for success at interview for a programming job.


Most interviewers are worse at interviewing than you are at attending interviews.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make yourself monstrously hireable in spite of all of the above.


Interviews for programming work typically contain the following 
elements in some order:

Non-technical questions for you
Questions you have for them
Technical challenges for you to complete

to help you find out how well the company does against your own personal criteria.

////Questions for you
The non-technical part of the interview is where you have opportunity 
after opportunity to demonstrate the value you would bring to a given 
organization. Your job is to seek out these opportunities and exploit them, 
for both your benefit and the interviewers.

No one hiring developers wakes up in the morning and says to themselves 
"I don't want to meet a technically competent candidate who can communicate 
as well as he can write code today."

Do a quick exercise: in your notebook write a list of the questions you 
think interviewers might ask you. What would you ask if you were hiring 
you and were given your CV? I'll do the exercise for myself right 
here as an example, but your questions will be different:

Tell me about your work history.
What experience do you have with Ruby on Rails?
It says here you can speak fluent Japanese, you're kidding, right?
What was your experience at #{past company} like?
What's a technically challenging thing you've worked on recently?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Where do you see yourself in five years time?
Are you more of a front end or back end developer?
What sort of role do you play on a development team?


For each of the questions you come up with, have an answer prepared. 
You can write out your answers in detail if you prefer
you can have a note book of the answer point to catch on in the interview

The goal is not to recite prepared answers to all possible questions, 
but simply to get in the mindset of talking confidently about your experience 
and skills.

Have stories to tell about your experiences so far, the technology 
you've used and the software you've built. Try to weave together a 
narrative about your work experience that the interviewer can follow easily.

There may be questions you haven't prepared for, 
but after thinking through answers for a good sample, 
you should be able to tackle most non-technical questions with confidence.

Where possible, you want to highlight skills and experience that are 
directly relevant to the work you would be doing at the interviewers company.




//////Questions for them
This is a chance to express what's important to you and demonstrate more value.

The company you're thinking about working for and what their goals are
The working conditions, technology, process and culture
The software that you will be building, and why you will be building it
Everything that was important to you about the role, as highlighted in your qualification stage.


Go to their website and find out what it is they do, 
how they make money and what their core values are. Play with their website 
(for bonus points, see if you can break it). 
Find out as much about them as you can.


Tell me about some software you've delivered to users in the past month.
(Do you regularly deliver working software?)
How do you measure the impact of your software on end users?
(How do you know what you're building is what your users actually need?)
Are you profitable?
(How secure is this job?)
Why are you hiring developers now?
How is developer time spread between maintenance and building new features?
(Am I going to be spending the majority of my time fighting fires?)
Tell me about your technology stack and architecture.
How do you organize developer work? Do you use an iterative development process?
What's the development teams stance on documentation? Unit testing? Code reviews?
What major projects is the development team working on at the moment? What's the strategic motivation behind them?
I see you're using {some tech} for {some task}, what made you choose it? How has your experience been with it so far?
How much downtime have you experienced in the past six months? Can you walk me through how you would respond to your website going down right now?
(Will I be expected to fix the website on weekends/late at night?)
Do you do user experience or A/B testing?
Do you have automated acceptance tests and dedicated QA?
Does the development team get time to improve the quality of the software?
(Will we have time to drain the swamp?)

sample of example questions
choose and add about things you care about from the list of priorities you made for yourself


Since you also took a bunch of notes about the organization, put together 
some questions specific to them. You're not interrogating them about the 
company here, just trying to get them to talk about their problems, 
day-to-day activities and things they would like to change or have done better. 
The more you can get them to talk about themselves, the better.


//////Technical Challenges
in a technical interview the only thing you can do 
is control your response to the situation as it is.

//situation: I lack completely the knowledge or skill to tackle this problem.
come clean straight away and let the interviewer know that your skillset 
doesn't extend to solving this particular problem.


//situation: I can probably solve this problem, 
but may need help/documentation along the way

Again, be honest. Tell the interviewer what you're not clear on, 
and repeat the problem back to them. Work through it with them rather
than attempt to solve the problem on your own.

In a good interview, most of the questions should be at this difficulty. 
Watching you apply your technical skills along with your creative and 
intellectual faculties to a non-trivial problem is the exact reason 
interviewers conduct technical challenges, so go slowly and make the most of it.


//situation: Give me 20 seconds... done!
Smaller coding problems like fizzbuzz, 'implement select without select' or 'implement 
a function that counts all the instances of each class in an array' are the 
sorts of problems you should quite literally be able to do with your eyes closed.

These sorts of programming challenges are a great opportunity to show off your 
skills with a little flamboyance. You could write a quick unit test for any 
function you're asked to write or show off a subtle language feature that 
they may not have heard of.

More random advice for doing well at these technical challenges:
Bring your own laptop.
Be honest about your skills.
If you get confused or nervous, take a break
Confirm your assumptions.

After the interview follow up





//////6. Compare Offers

You should have at least three offers at companies you would like to spend 
the next few years with in hand before making a decision. 

I think you should have multiple offers because:
Multiple offers give you more confidence.

helps to change your mindset from:
"Please give me this job, I'll work ever so hard for you!"
to:
"Let's find out what we have to offer each other."

The first is born of desperation, the second of the desire to exchange 
value as equals. Which do you think a potential hirer (worth working for) 
will prefer?


//Multiple offers allow (some degree) of playing offers against each other.
not just about salary
if you want to get something you want in the job, this is the time to ask it
not after you've accepted

You often won't need to do this sort of negotiating actively. 
Interviewers will ask if you have other offers or are interviewing elsewhere. 
If you've followed my advice, you should answer positively to both of those 
questions and give them details on the other offers, along with your reasoning 
about why you might pick one offer over others.


//The act of getting multiple offers teaches you more.
by going through all the interviews
you will have much more technical context about
how different types of development teams work
which can only be a good thing for you

Whatever you do, don't accept the first offer made to you straight away. 
Tell them you need at least a few weeks to think about it and ignore any 
high-pressure sales tactics ("we need a decision by tomorrow!") 
they throw in your direction. If they want to hire you, they'll wait.

With the offers in hand, all that's left is to compare them based on the 
criteria you listed at the beginning of this process.

(Side note: In my experience at least, outside of finance, 
full-time technical jobs tend to go up in quality with salary, 
especially at startups).

but for the long-term, nothing beats having a network of other 
developers/potential clients at your back when you're looking for work. 
You should take steps, starting today, to build that network and treat 
everyone in it like solid gold.

Employers that are hiring fresh grads or career changers usually aren't hiring 
for technical skills. What they are looking for is the ability to think critically 
and learn quickly. By showing your passion for learning about technology, 
you can really stand above the crowd.

1. Remember that you're the product.
use sales and marketing techniques

Understand five strengths and three weaknesses about yourself and be able 
to share your experiences with others in the form of a story

If there is a personal connection to the project or this is your life-long 
interest or purpose, people love to hear about it,



2. Know what you want.
The tech community is welcoming, friendly and helpful. 
Make it easier for others to help you quickly and effectively

That means having a clear-cut sense of your skill set and what you want in a job and an employer.


3. Always be prepared for a job opportunity.
Always have your resume, portfolio and Github updated and always 
be working on a project or improving your skills," 

Make sure your portfolio links are working, and be ready to explain 
your work effectively and succinctly

keeping three to five questions ready about the companies you're interested in; 
employers want to know you're interested in them and have done your homework.

4. Curate the content you read and watch.
start -- and follow companies and individual influencers on social media. 
Coursera, Udacity, Udemy and iTunes U as examples of where to look.


5. Get involved online.
Be involved in online open source communities (such as Github and Dribbble) 
and contribute your ideas to online forums and groups such as Quora and LinkedIn

Connect with and introduce yourself to [IT professionals] via social media 
[who work] at your list of companies


6. Develop personal projects that showcase your IT chops.

7. Consider the challenges potential employers face.

Most tech companies I've encountered are interested in sponsoring visas 
if they can afford to. The demand for engineers in the US is such that the 
local talent can't satisfy it.

A visa can cost companies anywhere between $2,500 to $10,000 in legal and 
USCIS fees to sponsor. Compared to an engineer's salary, this isn't usually 
a problem for companies — especially if they've raised some outside capital.

I find that usually any objections to sponsoring a visa boil down to 
the time costs, rather than anything else.

I suggest coming out to SF on your own accord, staying for a short while, 
and lining up a bunch of interviews with all the companies you're interested in.

you have to have a job offer to get the visa.

Some visas are dual intent (meaning you can have intent to stay permanently), 
and some of them are only meant to be temporary. 
This is an important distinction to make, and will affect your ability 
to get a green card in the future.

After 4 months of funemployment, 25 job applications and 6 weeks of 
constant interviewing, I’ve finally got a job at >Stripe.

Firstly, find the right level of confidence.

Secondly, everything becomes much easier when you accept that some 
people and some companies are better or worse at interviewing candidates 
than others, and that at this point in time it’s your job to play the ball 
as it lies.

I applied to 25 companies
17 asked me to do phone interviews, 8 either never replied or said no thanks straightaway
7 asked me to go to San Francisco for an on site interview
5 made me an offer

The internet does not do a good job of reminding you that very few people 
are programmatic celebrities and that you don’t have to be a polyglot or a 
prodigy in order to be an incredibly good hire. Even if you are “just” 
good at building stable, maintainable and vanilla Rails apps, you are still 
a very rare breed.

For almost all positions, open source contributions and active StackOverflow 
and Github profiles are just one of many nice-to-haves. Even if you do have a 
bunch of projects and other content on display, they’ll be used to evaluate 
your code quality, not your all-consuming passion for programming. 
Companies are aware that not everyone wants or is able to work on OSS, 
and if you don’t have any public code then they’ll just look at other 
indications of your skills instead.

you will still need to show a company in person that you can write good code 
and will be reasonable to work with.

If a position and company look fun, then apply, even if you don’t meet any of 
their requirements. The worst they can say is no, and the best they can say is 
“sure, let’s talk”, whereupon you can show them why you are awesome in 10 ways 
they hadn’t even thought of.


1.3 Yes, there is an "Engineer Crunch"
there are lots of jobs for engineers but not enough people with the skills 
to do them all. This means you will probably be able to get your feet in a 
lot of interesting doors.

1.4 But it's not that Crunchy
you can still be rejected,
because companies still have to hire people that fit their needs


//////2. Making applications
Whilst first impressions do matter, your cover letter/CV will quickly get 
forgotten when you start talking code, so all they really have to do is get 
you in the door and maybe be a bit memorable

2.3 Spreadsheet
Keep a spreadsheet with:

The company name
The date you applied
How much you like the company (scale of 1-4, use conditional formatting to colour-code)
The stage you are at (Applied/Phone Hello/Phone Tech/On Site/Offered)
If a company rejects you, move them to a separate list. You need to be able to see at a glance how many live applications you have and how many of them are actually interesting to you. Anything not on the above list is unnecessary and won’t get updated, so will just make your spreadsheet stale and less communicative.


2.4 Where to look
Hacker News Who’s Hiring thread
AngelList - like a dating site theme
LinkedIn - mostly spammy recruiters, small number in-house recruiters
    protip: set your location to where you are looking before you get there

Hired.com - this seems like a very interesting model, particularly for engineers. 
I was on auction for a week and received 8 credible-looking offers with actual 
proposed dollar amounts. None of the products felt like a fit for me, but the 
process was very easy and potentially disproportionately rewarding. 
In the worst case you still get some idea of your market value, although 
I would suggest only using your shot on it once you are in a position 
to actually follow up with any interesting offers.

Intros/direct applications - these will still likely make up the 
bulk of the top of your funnel. I made 10 applications this way.


2.5 Inbound interest
https://robertheaton.com/old-hire-me/




//////3. General Interviews
If you don’t have several interviews where you get completely annihilated 
(I had 3), then you probably didn’t make enough speculative applications.

If they make a mistake and it takes them an hour to work out that you are 
actually completely unsuited for the job then that’s not a big deal.

Once you hear how much recruiters’ fees are then you won’t feel bad or 
embarrassed when talking to a company ever again.


3.2 Standard general questions
You will inevitably gradually evolve your answers to the standard questions:

Tell me about yourself.
What are you looking for in your next:
Product?
Team? (size, culture etc)
Technical challenge?
Have you had experience scaling applications?
Tell me about a cool project you worked on recently (very important).


//3.3 You might think that some companies suck at interviews

But it’s not worth getting upset about. At pretty much every company you will 
be answering a series of 45-60 min code-oriented challenges, with a few 
curveballs thrown in for variety. Some of these will be purely algorithmic 
(although very rarely a standard, rote algorithm like merge sort), 
and some will be more focussed on architecture. 
But regardless, you will spend much of your interview time writing code. 
If this doesn’t appeal to you then, unfortunately, you will just have to get 
practicing.

Many companies include a 2-3 hour take-home technical challenge as part of their phone screen process.


//3.4 Systems design questions
Most companies will ask a question about designing a high-level (often distributed) 
system - what machines would you use, how would you arrange them, how would you 
deal with failures, how would you set up your database etc. If, like me, you have 
little practical experience with this stuff, then don’t lose any sleep over it. 
It’s all surprisingly logical and non-magical, and you can stumble through 
the problem, learn a few things, and reach a broadly sensible answer.

3.5 The one question I will give away
“Design the infrastructure for a link-shortener.”
“If I type https://google.com into my browser and press enter, what happens?”

You can talk about so many things on so many levels - DNS lookup, IP lookup, 
client/server-side caching, SSL/TLS and many more. A fun question to answer.


3.7 Do your own write-ups
In the current market, the engineering interview process is arguably more about 
you choosing a company than a company choosing you. Every interviewer you speak 
to will be writing detailed notes on you after you finish with them, and you 
should do exactly the same. All you need is a document in Evernote - 
“FooCorp Phone Interview 1/1/14” - with details of what they asked, 
what you replied, whether you liked the person, whether you liked the 
sound of the company, the answers to any questions you asked them and 
what the next steps are. You will forget all of this information within 
a couple of hours, so do it immediately after you finish.

3.8 Find out next steps
At the end of every phone and on-site interview, make sure you know exactly 
what the next steps are and when they will contact you by. This will make your 
planning far easier and will help in the follow up


//////4 Phone interviews
Phone interviews are surprisingly tiring. Don’t arrange too many in a 
row and make sure to give yourself breaks.


4.2 Things to learn
“Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for multiples 
of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five 
print “FizzBuzz”.”

It’s not a trick question, it really is as easy as it sounds, so just do it. 
Small gotcha: remember that for(var i=0; i<=100; i++) is technically wrong - 
you should be starting at 1, not 0.

Other common screening-type questions include the properties of common data 
structures (hashes, arrays, sets, trees, binary-search trees) and Big O 
complexities. It’s worth learning that sorting a array of N elements 
takes O(Nlog(N)) time, finding an element in a sorted array takes O(log(N)) 
time, and that the sum of the numbers from 1 to N (the actual sum, not the 
time taken to calculate this sum) is O(N^2). Pro-tip: the fact that 
Hashes have O(1) lookup time is often a great way to speed up an algorithm.

review depth-/breadth-first search, bit-shifting, programming language properties, 
and all the other things you haven’t thought about since CS 101 though. 
Again, it may upset you that these things aren’t directly related to what you’ll 
be doing on a day-to-day basis, but it’s what you’re mostly going to be asked about.


//////5. On-site interviews
//5.1 Length and energy
on site interviews are long can take 6 hours
ask if you can get something to eat or drink if you need one

5.2 Other people
If a company likes you, they’ll make you an offer, regardless of whether 
they dis/like someone else. So you don’t need to focus on other candidates

5.3 Misc
The first on-site interview of your job search won’t necessarily be terrible, 
but it will be much worse than your last.


//////6. Post-interview

//6.1 References
A surprisingly large number of companies want references. 
Line up 2 or 3 people you have worked with

//6.2 Don't worry
It’s easier said than done, but don’t worry about what did or didn’t go well. 
You don’t know what they were looking for, and even if you did there’s no 
point worrying about whether they found it.



//////7. Negotiation
salary negotiation 
http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/


7.2 Don't start negotiating until yes-if not no-but

7.3 Negotiation is not scary
only 1% of negotiation needs to be thinking of a big number and Jedi-mind-tricking 
your way towards it. The other 99% is having several viable options and making 
reasonable statements about their relative attractiveness to you. With strong 
BATNAs (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement), everything becomes much 
simpler.

7.4 Negotiation is not vulgar
People in startups (as well as many other professions) generally like to think 
that they are doing some version of “changing the world for the better.” 
And whilst this is a good and noble-ish thing, it can make you feel 
like a tool when you start talking about and debating salary and equity. 
After all, you should be doing this job for love, not money. Right?

It’s not at all vulgar or unreasonable or disloyal to want to feel fairly 
materially compensated, and any suggestion that there is anything wrong 
with negotiating in good faith with a profit-seeking enterprise is entirely 
disingenuous

Early-stage companies tend to claim poverty and offer salaries at anything 
down to 60% of market rate.

You have to find out the last round valuation of the company, 
the total number of shares issued, and the strike price of your options, 
otherwise an option grant is completely meaningless. It’s not rude to 
be persistent in trying to find this information, 
and it’s not distasteful to ask to be walked through the details 
of the offer until you understand it. Don’t comment on whether 
you are happy with an offer until you are clear what it actually is.


//7.6 Calm down
incredibly important.

That said, it’s easy to be too quick to fly into slightly-hostile-negotiation 
mode once a first offer comes through, without making it clear that you really 
appreciate the company’s interest and offer and really like them and what 
they’re doing, but don’t feel that the deal as it stands fairly reflects 
your value or matches up to your competing offers. It’s good to negotiate, 
but you should still be polite, understanding and open-minded about it.


//Conclusion
It’s a great market to be an engineer, but finding the right job still 
requires a lot of time and effort. Spray applications anywhere and everywhere 
you like the look of, and see what sticks. A little organisation will go a 
long way, but a little over-thinking will quickly make you go insane.

hopefully, with the right combination of luck, skill and more luck, 
you’ll even come out the other side with a job. Good luck!

it starts with you (before strategy)

self-assessment and goal-setting. If you don’t understand yourself, 
you won’t be happy with where you end up. Taking some time to introspect 
can make the process of getting hired a more manageable and strategic process.

Without defining what your own needs are, you will have no way of determining 
the right path forward so hunker down until you’ve got an idea of 
what your key needs are right now (from a job). 

The questions below should help you think about what is actually essential 
for you versus nice-to-have. Ask yourself:
//Needs:
Why do I need a job?
What kind of salary level do I need to sustain myself and my family?
What kind of job security level do I need to sustain myself and my family?
How desperate am I to get a job right now?


//Where You Want To Be:
Once you’ve been honest with yourself about your needs, 
it’s time to figure out what you want. What will your future needs be? 
What kinds of companies do you want to work at?

Why do I want a job in web development?
What kind of career path do I want to have?
Do I want to work in a developer-led organization (vs sales- or business-led)?
Do I prefer working in a team environment or remotely?
Do I like working long hours / weekends or 9-6?
Is the work more important than the people?
Do I have to care about the product I’m building?
Do I have to care about the technologies I’m using?
Do I prefer an “easy” work environment or one where I’m constantly pushed?
Do I want “creature comfort” incentives like free food and beer at the office?
Do I have to enjoy my work or can I power through a crappy job?



//Prioritizing Needs and Wants
You should have at least an informal list of the things that matter to you. 
Now ruthlessly rank them. What are your non-negotiables and what are your 
nice-to-haves? Every company and opportunity will fall somewhere on 
the spectrum defined by those questions and they are the criteria you 
will later use to evaluate them. This will help you stay focused 
when considering opportunities and not spread yourself too thin 
chasing things that you wouldn’t really choose anyway.


Make sure you know every one of your “must-haves” and your top 5 priorities 
for “nice-to-haves” in a job.


//What Are Your Assets and Liabilities?
It’s time to be honest with yourself… what do you bring to the table? 
If you’re early in your career (which you probably are), 
you’ll have to work hard to distinguish yourself from the flood of unqualified 
candidates out there. 
You need to strike the line between being honest with yourself 
and not selling yourself short.

Everyone, especially those just starting out, feels unqualified. 
That’s natural, so don’t worry about it.

This is about figuring out your strengths and weaknesses so you can 
tailor your story to play to your strengths and honestly address your weaknesses.

How hungry am I?
How good am I at building back end code?
How good am I at putting together front ends?
Can I solve really technical problems like brain teasers and algorithms?
Have I built projects that display a good range of skills?
Do I know people who can recommend me?
Am I a good people person who builds relationships easily?
Do I portray an aura of confidence or act shy?
Do I tend to undersell myself and my capabilities?
Do I have a broad level of general tech knowledge?
Am I very familiar with a particular technical or industry vertical? (Usually career switchers have one)
Do I tend to procrastinate or do I just get shit done?
Do I wait to ask for help or do I go out and find the answer on my own?
Do I lean in to challenges or avoid them?
What are some really difficult problems I’ve solved before?


Applying without much experience means you need to fill in your weak 
spots and emphasize your strengths. For almost everyone, your biggest 
strength will be hunger and ability to learn. But companies have heard 
that story before, so you’ll have to tie in other strengths that you 
can to make your story compelling.

there is a difference between hunger for opportunity and desperation. 
Hunger is about seeking reward (which you can do when you’re in a comfortable 
situation and optimizing opportunities) and desperation is about avoiding 
failure (which occurs when you absolutely MUST have that job). 
Do whatever it takes to not sound desperate, even if you are.

What Companies you want

You have to think about things from the perspective of the company. 
Why are they interested in hiring you? What, therefore, will they look for?

Hiring managers are busy people. That’s why they need someone new… to remove some 
of their workload and get their team working better or faster. 
They also have to deal with potentially hundreds of unqualified applicants 
every week, which takes up too much of their valuable time. 
They just want to get back to building stuff and not have to hire again 
anytime soon. So they are looking for someone who can add value as soon 
as possible and who will be able to grow with the organization.

So to summarize, hiring managers are usually looking for 3 main things:

Capability
Motivation
Fit

The first part, adding value immediately, is more difficult – 
that’s where they want to see that you’ve had relevant experience 
before and can meet their technical bar. There’s a bit of a catch-22 
with getting hired – the easiest way to show you are employable 
is to have been employed before. It’s a check mark next to you. 
So to cater to this; do whatever you can to show that other 
people have believed in you enough to use your work and skills.


The second characteristic, growth, is something you shouldn’t have much 
trouble selling if you’ve come this far and learned web development on your own. 
The key is to present yourself as a growth curve, not just a static line 
(i.e. you’ll continue learning and improving very rapidly and not stop). 
You have real career goals and you’ve learned incredibly fast so far to 
get to where you are (right?).


Aside from those two characteristics, there is another major factor – fit. 
The hiring manager wants someone they and their team can work well with.

you often make or break your chances by being someone the team members 
want to know better and work with all day long. Almost all hiring processes 
ask the full team to evaluate a late-stage candidate.



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

software development is 95 percent design and 5 percent construction
Software developers are not engineers.


can learn a new skill, e.g., a new programming language, in a matter of a few days. 
This is because they have a natural ability to think in design terms 
and they can easily use whatever tools are available.

During the interview process the person doing the interview should “talk” 
to the candidate. Ask them about what they like, what they have done, 
what things excite them, etc. However, be sure that the people undertaking 
the interviews are in fact talented interviewers. 
They’ll recognize quickly if this is the “right” person or not.

I am one of the key interviewers for my company, usually giving 
5 - 10 interviews / week, ranging in candidates like test engineers, 
software engineers, software architects, project managers, program managers, 
and product managers. While a typical interview with me lasts for 45 minutes, 
I probably have 2 - 3 hours worth of interview material.

Senior people are always easy to hire; as they know their area of expertise

So how do you sort out the candidates with potential from the ones who 
are just repeating what they memorized in the latest programming book they read. 
The basic knowledge is usually the same. The candidates most all be competent 
in your technology of choice, they must get along with your team, and they 
must fit your budget range. Now the hard part, once you've identified a 
few candidates that fit these basic criteria, how do you know who will 
really succeed? Who will improve your team? Who will exceed your expectations?


Evaluate Problem Solving. Try and find out how the candidate works through a 
problem that they don't know the answer. How do you weigh a 747? Why are 
manhole covers round? How many cars are there in New York City? Questions 
like this are not designed to reach the answer, but to see how the candidate 
thinks. How do they respond to help? Do they ask questions? Do they break 
down the question logically or randomly? These are some key indicators for 
imaging the candidate 6 months down the road when you have to develop a 
solution that no one on the team has ever seen before. Maybe an obscure 
defect that you can't reproduce These situations will inevitably come up, 
and you want your team best prepared to handle the unknown, and be able to 
breakdown a problem logically.

Hire Smart People
Admitting Ignorance. Throw out some questions that the candidate has no way 
to answer. Don't throw out a brain teaser for this one, but throw out something 
extremely technical or deep, or on a technology just outside of their knowledge 
level.
Anyone who can admit they don't know something when they are engaged 
in an interview is someone with the maturity you are looking for. 
Professional maturity is a great indicator for future success, 
knowledge transfer, and constant growth.

Communication Counts. 
Try to get the candidate to explain something complex to you. 
Did you understand it? Was the information presently structurally or randomly? 
How long did he consider his answer? Was he comfortable launching into a diatribe? 
At the end of the day, communication is key for any team,
As long as someone can clearly express their status, position, opinion, thoughts, 
really anything, then your chances for team success have just gone up exponentially.


Career Goals are Good
You want to make sure that your candidate has some goals, 
and he's on the path to reach them. The actual goals aren't very important, 
it is that there is a career plan being executed. It shows forethought, 
direction, and purpose.

and all you are trying to do as the hiring manager is to hire the candidate 
with the highest likelihood of succeeding.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The corollary of that rule—the rule that the great people are never on 
the market—is that the bad people—the seriously unqualified—are on the market 
quite a lot. They get fired all the time, because they can’t do their job. 
and they ruin the company

competent people. They’re on the market more than the great people, 
but less than the incompetent, and all in all they will show up in small 
numbers in your 1000 resume pile

have to be able to figure out who the right programmers are

The in-person interview is just one part of the hiring process, 
which starts with sorting resumes and a phone screen.

if you spend less than one hour on an interview you’re not going to be able to make a decision.

You’re looking for people who are
Smart, and (thoughtful)
Get things done.(practical)

How do you detect smart in an interview? The first good sign is that 
you don’t have to explain things over and over again. The conversation just flows.

Who cares what the difference is? You can find out online in about fifteen 
seconds! Remember, smart does not mean “knows the answer to trivia questions.”

Anyway, software teams want to hire people with aptitude, 
not a particular skill set. Any skill set that people can bring 
to the job will be technologically obsolete in a couple of years, anyway, 
so it’s better to hire people that are going to be able to learn any new 
technology rather than people who happen to know how to make JDBC talk 
to a MySQL database right this minute.

But in general, the way to learn the most about a person is to let them 
do the talking. Give them open-ended questions and problems.

There are actually hundreds of famous Microsoft interview questions. 
Everybody has a set of questions that they really like.

Here’s a typical plan for interviewing a programmer:

Introduction
Question about recent project candidate worked on
Easy Programming Question
Pointer/Recursion Question
Are you satisfied?
Do you have any questions?

don’t ask around about the person before you interview them

we are interested in how they go about solving problems, not the actual answer.

One: Look for passion. Smart people are passionate about the projects they work on. 
They get very excited talking about the subject. They talk quickly, 
and get animated. Being passionately negative can be just as good a sign. 

Two: Good candidates are careful to explain things well, at whatever level.
in terms that a normal person could understand. 

A good answer to this might be “I got together with the other members of 
the team and wrote a proposal…” 

Most of the time in the interview, though, should be spent letting the candidate 
prove that they can write code.

Reassure candidates that you understand that it’s hard to write code without 
an editor, and you will forgive them if the whiteboard gets really messy. 
Also you understand that it’s hard to write bug-free code without a compiler, 
and you will take that into account.

Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z
Write a function that determines the area of a circle given the radius
Add up all the values in an array

everybody solved the problem, but there was a lot of variation in how long it took them to solve.

And the same thing happens in programming. If the basic concepts aren’t so 
easy that you don’t even have to think about them, you’re not going to get 
the big concepts.

Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some 
people just can’t do

recursion and functional programming in one class and C or Pascal with 
data structures in another class

When was the last time you had to write a sorting algorithm?

I want programmers to know programming down to the CPU level

Even though the format of the interview is, superficially, just a 
candidate writing some code on the whiteboard, my real goal here 
is to have a conversation about it. “Why did you do it that way?” 
“What are the performance characteristics of your algorithm?” 
“What did you forget?” “Where’s your bug?”

Notice that the kinds of hints I’m happy to provide are really just answers 
to trivia questions—the kinds of things that you find on Google.

All programmers make mistakes, there’s nothing wrong with that, 
they just have to be able to find them.

the good candidates have lots of choices about where to work and they’re 
using this day to figure out if they want to work for you.

It’s against the law to talk based on national origin, personal life.
Basically, stick to questions which are completely relevant to the job 
for which they are interviewing.

Show vs tell
Putting java on your resume and showing employers that you can develop 
in java incorporating object oriented principles is much more effective.

showing your java and OO abilities and including how you continue to 
improve and grow in this area by taking classes and joining meetups and 
forums is a recruiter’s dream come true

Collaborative coding
Why should you love a collaborative code management site like Github?  
If your account is public, potential employers can see your activity.  
Are you contributing to projects?  Are you building your own projects?

Open communication and collaboration is important to employers and to communities.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////






Internships
A good way to start getting experience and show others that you’re employable 
is to get an internship. Just make sure it’s a paid internship because no one 
values things they get for free. You want the people you work with to value 
your contributions and feel like they have a stake in helping you succeed. 
The good part is that internships tend to focus more on your growth potential 
than what you’ve done before


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
How do I get a software internship?

You contribute to open-source projects. Your github account is your portfolio, 
and if you don't have one, fix that.

I've worked at a convenience store...

"Showed up on-time, was courteous and professional with colleagues and customers, 
was able to learn to do the job and was trustworthy enough to manage the cash 
and close up by themselves", those are not nothing.

Yes. It's kind of understood that you don't know much but are teachable at 
that level.

Shows up on time, is courteous and professional with customers and colleagues, 
is able to learn to do the job and is trustworthy enough to handle important 
responsibilities themselves.

What dose expect interns to do? Fix bugs, implement small features. 
They do real work, but not the hardest of the work. Often, things full 
time employees would find boring (this doesn't work in Internet explorer...)

Don't psych yourself out. Software engineering is one of the few markets 
that still has a reasonable amount of demand in this economy. 
Plus, you're doing this work for next to free. You do not have to grovel 
for an internship, especially if you've been motivated enough to 
come up with your own projects outside of your coursework.

Depends on the employer. At my (tiny) company, our intern doesn't have a 
CS degree but is expected to assist on research that is designed to 
improve the quality of our data. Interns at the larger company 
I used to work at contributed significant code that led to their eventual 
integration in the company.


Employers do not expect you to know everything, or really even anything. 
They expect you to be able to learn quickly and to be able to find the resources you need to accomplish your goals.
They expect you to ask questions. 
They expect you to understand that you know next to nothing about the code base and product. 
They expect you to be relatively easy to get along with and to show up on time.


employers look for enthusiasm, personality fit, and problem solving ability. 
Remember that problem solving ability includes the ability to ask questions, 
ask for help, and communicate effectively. 

At a bare minimum, your cover letter should indicate that you've thought about 
the position and why your skillset/interests would be a good fit for the company. 
You don't need to mention your work at a convenience store unless you're 
applying for a customer facing position.

look professional and tidy. If they like you, it doesn't really matter what 
you wear. If they don't like you, your clothes are probably about last on the 
reasons they don't want to hire you.


ct like your projects matter. Demonstrate that you have some passion 
for what you are doing
a lot of my classmates have been far less successful in getting responses 
or call backs, but they flat-out admit they’re in it for money and it shows.

You can gain practical experience at any job. Communication skills, 
strong work ethic, examples of teamwork, and examples of problem-solving 
are good things to mention on your resume.

Try and talk to recruiters and be enthusiastic.
Be aggressive, but not annoying.

You want to show that you're bright and learn new stuff fast. 
List your projects. List relevant coursework. If you've got nontrivial 
code to point to (on github, for example), do that.

I help my interns pick a project where a) they will design, write, review, 
and test code with other engineers on a team, b) they will learn new things, 
and c) they will launch before they leave

Being in it for the experience is a great attitude, 
but you want to intern at a good company. At good companies CS interns are paid.

I only care about whether you can code and whether 
you can listen and follow directions.

I'm not talking about things that took thousands of lines of code, but things 
that took advantage of existing libraries, or are little programs that show 
some creative thinking.
FWIW, I now work as a software engineer at a Fortune 500 company. And yes, the first internship was invaluable.

There are a few reasons employers hire software development interns:
* Cheap labor: 
* Talent Scouting/Development

The single most important thing you can do is to have a project on GitHub, 
or to contribute to an open source project. I can't emphasize this enough. 
If you have code on the web, I WILL pull it down and look at it. 
So make sure that your code is well formatted and commented (and works!).

What you can do to prepare

Taking a structured approach to getting hired means starting early 
and getting some important things out of the way first.

Get Good!
address your weak points (even if it’s the tricky stuff like algorithms 
and data structures) in order to be qualified for the kinds of positions 
you’re applying to.

It really means crafting a story about who you are, 
how you got to where you are, 
and why you’ll keep growing.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

////Build a Portfolio
Employers want to see that you can build and ship code and that you 
make good decisions when confronted with engineering trade-offs. 
All of this stems from conversations about your portfolio of work.

The portfolio is also important for another thing that isn’t mentioned 
much – social proof. If you’ve been a part of larger or group projects, 
that’s almost like showing that you’ve worked somewhere before. It makes 
the employer comfortable that other people have worked with you before so 
they can too.

Your portfolio as a developer is GitHub.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Portfolio
Take the time you need to produce something that will impress them--it'll 
really pay off.

As a fellow developer, I can appreciate the beauty of a well-designed console 
application, or a clever applet with hardly any interface at all. 
If you've written code you're particularly proud of, show me that.

more important is that you are excited about what you worked on.

If you took the time to highlight the cool stuff and bring it with you, 
that already puts you far ahead

After narrowing down the project list, include relevant details for each project. 
Basic details that should always be included are the project name, your role in 
the development cycle, a description of what the code does, a high-level 
description of how it works, and the skills, programming language, 
and technology stack used.

write about any challenges that were overcome during the course of development.

have a section of your resume with clickable links to your portfolio and 
anything else that is relevant (GitHub, Bitbucket, Programming Blog, 
Stack Overflow, etc.).


Software Engineers Are In Demand, And GitHub Is How You Find Them

I know of a dozen startup founders who regularly spend time on GitHub, 
looking for engineers and programmers they can add to their team

People grow their reputation through the number of "commits" 
(updates to code that they authorize) and "forks" 
(copies of existing projects that they take in an alternate direction) 
in their "repos" (code repositories).

A commit to GitHub matters lot more to us than the resume.”

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Clean up your Web Presence (and Have One)

Google yourself in an incognito window (to avoid Google’s smart algorithm). 
What comes up? Do the links fit into your personal narrative? 
Whoever is looking to hire you will certainly Google you.

Make sure that what they find matches what you want them to find.

If you’ve got a ridiculously common name, you may have a harder time building 
your web presence but it’s also harder to have the wrong web presence.

The most important part of your web presence to fix up is your GitHub profile. 
Make sure your projects are organized and their README files contain a description 
and a link to where it is live so anyone looking at the project can quickly 
see your brilliance.

Next, try to be discoverable. If we’re trying to get in touch with you or 
find your work on the web, can I? Do you have a personal website? 
Are you on Twitter? You don’t need to go crazy with social media, 
but sometimes just having enough of a profile to be a “real” person 
and give people the opportunity to get in touch with you can go a long way.

LinkedIn is fast replacing the resume.

Own you Domain
with your own name

The good news here is that you can use the blog to promote yourself 
(or your business) and control what shows up on Google at the same time. 
A warning, though: While blogs are cheap and relatively easy to set up, 
don’t start one unless you have the discipline and writing skills to maintain it.

An untended blog grows the equivalent of “digital weeds” that will 
undermine the positive impression you’re trying to make. 

However, if you do decide to launch a blog, the Google-owned Blogger.com 
blogging platform ranks crazy-high in searches. Coincidence? Another option 
is Wordpress, where you can incorporate your name into your blog URL, 
which can also improve your search rank. Remember it’s always best 
to have your own domain.

Find a reporter to write about your volunteer project, write an article for 
a business journal or guest post on a popular blog you follow. 
The trick here is to keep it going so you can (hopefully) bury whatever 
it is you don’t want people to locate under an avalanche of things you do. 
Also, your comments on high-profile sites can show up in results as well, 
so use them as an opportunity for others to see you at your very best

ability to pass a background check than anything else;


having an online presence is different from having a presence that shows 
you are active in your programming community. Blogging, answering questions 
on forums or Stack Exchange sites, participating in open source (or starting 
such) projects, writing articles etc show that. All of these are bonuses as 
far as good employers are concerned.

None of the above are requirements for getting a job, but they are all 
good to have in order to increase your chances. In other words, given 
two candidates that score similarly on the points the employer cares about, 
if one shows participation in the community and the other doesn't, 
the one that does will have a better chance at getting the offer.

They will search the applicants that passed the first stage online, 
on Google and other social sites. They will check blogs, github, bitbucket, 
SE like sites, mailing lists, forums etc. to get to know you a little bit more, 
to see if you worth an interview.

Now, if you have a strong resume (work experience in related areas, 
good references etc.), the online search part may not matter much.

I’d like to give more techniques on how to build out your 
professional image by showcasing your skills and experience online.


resources give validity, credibility, and interactivity to your brand 

GitHub your way to glory
GitHub is a crown jewel for developers. Be sure to show off your most 
elegant code and highlight any projects you’ve worked on. Tidy up your READMEs, 
choose descriptive variable names, and use a consistent coding style.

Recruiters will use GitHub to investigate the projects you’ve worked on and 
check out your code. In this way, the more information you can provide about 
your software engineering skills, the more compelling a candidate you are.

Make sure your social media profiles show that you’re an intelligent, 
well-meaning thinker and team player. Your online behavior should always 
align with your personal brand. Make sure there’s nothing on your profiles 
that could botch your professional image.

Highlight your social media profiles in your applications if you use them 
to voice ideas about your industry, share new content, or engage with your 
professional network.

Show pride in your work, interest in your next career move, 
and a hunger for breakout ideas.

Get Out in the Community and Collect Information
Find and meet other developers.
genuine human connection
for now, it’s probably just for answering questions and harvesting advice but your
next job will probably be found through the people you know and 
some who you meet while you’re gathering this advice. 

People like giving advice and like investing themselves emotionally 
in other people with growth curves.

what exactly different jobs are and what they’re looking for. 
The easiest way to find out is ask developers what they do.

Set a goal of talking to 5 real human beings about your job search.

Another way to get this information is to check out a whole bunch of job postings.

don’t be afraid to produce content like blogging or answering questions on Quora. 
They don’t need to be explicitly technical, but should showcase your ability 
to think critically and write well. Both of these play well with future employers.

it’s best to keep your site simple, clean and to the point 
rather than bloated and full of “look what I can do!” features. 
Let your portfolio of work speak for itself.


56% of all hiring managers are more impressed by a candidate’s personal 
website than any other personal branding tool

only 7% of job seekers actually have a personal website.


One, it gives hiring managers a glimpse into your personality, 
he says. “A website gives you creative freedom to express your personality 
in ways that are not be possible through your resume.

Everything from the bio paragraph you write to the design options you choose 
for your website says something about you, and gives recruiters more chances 
to decide

your own website allows you to control what people will find when 
they search for you.

“Keep information interesting, but relatively neutral,”

“Avoid providing information that might be controversial such as religious 
or political views. Always keep the word ‘relevance’ in mind. Ask yourself: 
Is this relevant to the employer and to the position?”


Here’s what your website should have:
//A Focus
why this website ?
what is the purpose ?
who will read it ?
what skills and information you want to highlight ?

//contact information
in header and footer in every page

Leave off your home address and keep contact information more general--such 
as your name, e-mail and phone number,” 


//A brief bio. 
An “About Me” page can be helpful to hiring managers—but be sure to keep 
it professional and brief.

you can provide any additional information that may not be on your 
resume or cover letter, such as interests, hobbies, or awards and 
accomplishments.

Pooley says if you want to include a professional photo, 
this is a good place to display it. “It should be a high-quality, 
preferably professionally-taken, headshot or wide shot. 
Avoid the temptation to use a smartphone photo, especially if you took 
it yourself.”


//Your resume. 
You should always include your resume, Brooks says. 
“Keep in mind that a potential employer may only be provided with 
your website URL,” Kahn adds. “Make sure they have access your 
resume on the website so they can get a fulsome picture of your 
qualifications.”

//Professional summary/objective.
short, descriptive bio helps explain to visitors what you do and how you 
can help them,”
And it will encourage visitors to keep reading.

//Samples of your work. 

//Results and performance from previous work

//Links
to professional associations you're a member of
links to any articles about you
which quote you
links to professional journals or other important readings
related to your profession
this will help the potential employer know that you are committed to
and knowledgeable about your profession

linking to podcasts or audios you've recorded, 
as well as any professional social media streams.

You can include short videos where you present information or ideas 
related to your field, short tutorials, or other creative explanations 
of your work and your field. For instance, a counselor might include 
a short video about tips for overcoming procrastination or setting goals

Documentation
Don’t underestimate the importance of high quality documentation on your projects. 
As a professional developer writing good documentation is a must. 
As a job seeker it’s a hidden opportunity to shine. 
Your projects should include a useful README and at least one screenshot. 
Include a section about why you built the project and another section with 
instructions to run the project locally.

written for both technical and non-technical audience


code comments explain the why, and not the how, 
documentation serves the same purpose.

people need to understand why your code might be useful for them, before they decide to use it. Documentation tells people that this project is for them.

If people don’t know why your project exists,
they won’t use it.
If people can’t figure out how to install your code,
they won’t use it.
If people can’t figure out how to use your code,
they won’t use it.

You only get contributions after you have put in a lot of work.
You only get contributions after you have users.
You only get contributions after you have documentation.

It’s really easy to have an idea in your head that sounds perfect, 
but the act of putting words to paper requires a distillation of 
thought that may not be so easy.

Writing documentation improves the design of your code. 
Talking through your API and design decisions on paper allows you 
to think about them in a more formalized way.

allows people to contribute code that follows your original intentions as well.

Writing documentation will start you down the road to being a better technical 
writer, which is a useful skill to have as a programmer.

appeal to users (want to use your code) and 
developers (who want to contribute back to your code)

what your project does and why it exists.

Once people figure out whether they want to use your code or not, 
they need to know how to actually get it and make it run. 
Hopefully your install instructions should be a couple lines for the basic case.

Best Places to look
Your network (including people you’ve met in the community)

Direct postings that go to a human (like when developers [not recruiters] 
send emails about job opening at their company to the local Ruby list). 
It’s important to have another human being on the other end of the emails.

Direct postings (like on a company website for a specific position). 
These will also usually go to a specific human being.

Job boards (pretty much awful, you’re in the herd now)

//////On Recruiters
There are a lot of recruiters out there whose job it is to get you hired, 
but you’ll need to be careful about how you work with them. 

For starters, 
they get paid based on a percentage of the salary you take, 
so their incentive is to get you paid as much as possible (which is good). 

Unfortunately as a junior developer your salary is much lower than 
a senior engineer so you will not be their priority 
and they won’t spend much time on you (which is bad).


If you’re approached out of the cold as a junior developer by a recruiter, 
chances are that they won’t be going out of their way to learn your 
story and find you the right fit – you’re more likely to get put 
in the pile of resumes they send out to everyone. 
You probably don’t yet have work experience that is salable enough 
for them to go out of their way to find you the right position. 
In that case, you may find them sending out your resume to everyone 
just in hopes that they get their 20-30%. Remember – if they 
approached you in a spammy way (e.g. through LinkedIn), 
they probably do the same to companies so it’s doubtful they’ll add value to you.

As you become more senior and your work is more unique, 
recruiters can add a lot of value to your career

so you probably won’t find value in working with recruiters yet. Rely on your own ability to hustle and sell yourself.

Qualifiying for job leads

Look through each lead on your spreadsheet and cross off the ones that 
fail your “must-have” criteria, then rank them based on your “nice-to-have” 
criteria.

You should be able to easily come up with a weighting system that 
lets you sort the jobs in order of preference.

Simpler is better, so no need to go overboard.

Next, make a column for the percentage likelihood of getting the 
job with a reasonable effort. Multiply this with the value of the 
job based on the previous step, sort by this new “expected value”, 
and you should have an indication of which jobs are most worth your time.

If the job happens to be with one of the many companies like Revature 
that offer to train you for free before contracting you out,
these less-than-ideal opportunities.
https://github.com/TheOdinProject/blog/blob/main/hire-beware.md

Part of the reason for qualifying the leads is to make sure you don’t get 
sucked into a process and waste a bunch of time applying to jobs that you 
wouldn’t actually take anyway.

That’s surprisingly easy. You’ll still be able to send out “practice” applications, 
but at least now you know which companies are worth sending those out to.

Some other criteria to think about in the “nice-to-have” column:

How easily can I continue to learn at that job?
Is there access to mentors and teaching?
How good are my peers who I can learn from?
How much would I like going into work each day?
What are the job-security risks of the job? Corporations aren’t lock-tight just because they’re big… they go through restructuring phases and lay off people with little good reason.
Does it pay well enough to support me?
Does its location fit the needs of me and my family?
How long do I want this (first) job for?

You could work with a quality team that builds real, marketable skills.

Do your research, ask questions, and ensure you understand all the implications 
of joining any of these companies that offer paid training to then contract 
you out as a consultant.

Building your Resume

The goal of a resume is to get them interested enough to start a conversation. 
From there, it’s on you to speak intelligently about the things you’ve done

So don’t treat the resume as the catch-all repository of your whole life
it’s more of a focused marketing tool designed to make you seem worth taking another look at.

A developer’s resume is an interesting thing because so much of your value is 
demonstrated from your projects, which live in your GitHub (and are hopefully 
also deployed somewhere online). Despite this focus on projects, you can’t 
ignore previous work experience or education. They are both important 
for showing the social proof that other people have worked with you 
before and you’ve met their standards for applying.

The keys to remember are the perspective of the hiring manager we talked 
about before – that person wants to hire a developer who is highly 
capable and can get shit done (and will add value ASAP).

The hiring manager will determine these criteria in less than 10 seconds 
at first glance based on :
. where you’ve been educated 
. who’s hired you before
. if you’ve got any really interesting projects that stand out.


The hiring manager rapidly builds a story of who you are based on 
those headline items of your resume. If you’re lucky, that high level 
story will seem interesting enough for the hiring manager or HR person 
to look twice and actually read what you did at each job and then 
bring you in for an interview.

Knowing that perspective, how can you play to it? It’s difficult if you’re breaking 
into a new industry so you’ll need to emphasize relevant education, 
work experience and projects in a way that crafts a story of drive and 
capability. What have you done that shows you’re highly capable 
(e.g. your technical chops, any recognition you’ve received, 
leadership of teams)? And can get shit done (e.g. interesting projects, 
open source contributions)?

Applying For Web Development Jobs
Don’t send all your applications out at once! You’ll get totally 
overwhelmed if you start hearing back from people and need to complete 
tasks all at once.

Treat it like an iterative process where you’ll send out several applications 
each day, learn from any mistakes you can identify based on feedback from 
the process, and try again the next day.

This is NOT an excuse to procrastinate or only send out one application a day. 
You should have a definite goal for number of applications per day. 3? 5? 10?


Over time, you will work your way through your excel list. It’s usually good 
to start at the bottom with the companies that you would barely work at. 
Once you feel comfortable with your application-sending and hopefully 
interviewing abilities, you can start tackling the companies at the top 
that you really want to work for.

//////Go in the Side Door
Where do you start? Do two things at once – send applications to a 
few companies towards the bottom of your list to practice 
but also look at the top companies on your list and build a strategy. 
Remember, the best way to get in is to NOT use their online 
resume drop but to instead identify a real human being at the 
company and connect with that person somehow. Even better is 
to be so publicly brilliant that they come to you but… we can’t have it all.

for the companies you'd really like to work for
you can also potentially get noticed by tailoring your project work to them. 
You’ll be building projects (I hope) to stay in practice anyway, 
so make one of those a clone of the top company’s website with a 
new feature you’d like to see, then use that to display your interest.

Get to know the company and its needs and see if you can reach out to address 
them somehow. Do they have local events you can visit? What do they sponsor? 
This stuff takes creativity. You need to walk the line where you’re not a 
stalker but you do care enough to push hard. If you’re wrong, they may say no. 
It happens, you’ll live and move on. But you’d better try! You’ll probably 
figure things out that will help you with other companies anyway.

Want to Work for a Start-up? Here's How to Get Noticed

working for an early-stage tech company is either an insanely risky 
or incredibly rewarding move.

If you’re extremely driven, passionate, and willing to dive right in 
(and you understand the differences between the start-up world and everywhere else), 
this type of gig can be a great way to grow your career.



I asked people from several burgeoning companies to share what type of 
applicants they look to hire, and how you can set yourself apart from 
everyone else.

//Everlasting Curiosity and the Ability to Adapt
If you’re looking for a job, you’re obviously looking for some form of change. 
But at a start-up gig, change is most likely non-stop, so you’ll need to 
embrace it—and be prepared to quickly adapt and evolve along with it.

have you ever suggested new company initiatives or programs, 
or learned a brand new skill that became valuable to the team? 
These things all prove curiosity and willingness to shake things up 
and evolve the business.


//Check Your Ego at the Door
But sometimes, that all-hands-on-deck approach means taking on 
extra work and wearing hats you might not have expected.

‘Handyman’ and ‘Team Dad’ weren't part of the job description, 
but he thrives at a start-up because he doesn't wait around for someone 
to tell him what to do. He proactively finds problems that need to be solved, 
and just takes care of business.”

Think about ways you can bring your natural talents or hobbies to 
the table to help out the team—this could mean teaching a coding 
class to the non-developers, taking a junior employee who needs 
the extra guidance under your wing, or offering to launch and 
manage the company blog—and explain why you’re excited to do that 
during the interview process.

//Don't Just Do Your Homework—Go for Extra Credit
Some job applicants have famously been known to create resume infographics, 
dedicated social media accounts, or websites that showcase why they should 
be hired for the job.

What’s the magic formula for your dream company? Stalk the company and its 
employees online, find out what makes them tick, and then figure out 
how you can contribute

I'm always surprised by the number of candidates who don't submit a cover letter, 
much less a video! If you truly want a position at a start-up, doing extra 
credit like a video (even if it's an unedited webcam clip) can go a long 
way in distinguishing yourself from other candidates.

In addition, we pay close attention to what candidates choose to ask during 
phone interviews. Do their questions reflect mostly what they can get out of 
working here or what they can contribute? It's awesome when people skip the 
typical, broad ‘day-in-the-life’ and ‘company culture’ questions and dig 
much deeper into what we do, how we do it, and what we're looking for.”


//Show Your Passion for the Product
If you’re already an active user or advocate of the company’s product or service, 
it shows that you’re passionate about the same things that the employees are, 
and that you really get what they’re trying to do. Whether 
it’s providing unsolicited and constructive feedback about 
your experience using the company’s product or service, 
starting insightful discussions on the company's blog posts, 
or engaging with its social media accounts, these actions all 
go a long way in proving you are already a natural evangelist 
and spokesperson for its mission.

“We actually get a lot of job inquiries via our site's general ‘Contact Us’ link. 
I think there's something very telling of an individual who reaches out this way; 
it shows that he or she is both proactive and, more importantly, a user 
and appreciator of our product. It's exciting to know someone loves what 
we're doing that much.”

//Be Indispensable
What happens when you’re passionate about the work that an early-stage company 
is doing, but said company doesn’t yet have the budget or capacity to hire? 
Consider working on a part-time or volunteer basis. 
This may not work for everyone, but if it fits your lifestyle, 
interning or demonstrating your value in other ways can help get 
your foot in the door.

If you're dying to work for a company, don't be afraid to put in a 
little time first to prove your worth!”

If you can prove you have what it takes to go above and beyond the 
typical job description, take risks, thrive beyond your comfort zone, 
and exude unstoppable drive and curiosity, you’ve already set yourself 
apart from the pack. And you're that much closer to getting your 
foot in the door of a fast-rising start-up.

Perseverance Through the Process
One of the key parts of the process, though, is keeping your spirits up. 
It SUCKS looking for jobs full time. You can go weeks without hearing a 
peep from anyone. Then you’ll have a day where you get an interview and your 
spirits will soar and then you won’t pass and you’ll feel like crap again. 
Then you’ll get another three interviews in one day and it’ll be crazy 
for a time before another long waiting period. The inconsistency of it 
is maddening, so do what you need to in your own life to make sure you 
don’t let it get you down.

It’s also really important to not act/sound desperate, 
even though you probably are. No one wants to hire someone 
who is desperate because it violates so much of the social 
proof that people use to figure out if you’re a good candidate – 
if no one else will hire you and you’re so desperate, it makes them 
wonder what’s wrong with you. And, frankly, there’s nothing wrong… 
everyone goes through a grueling process when they start looking for jobs.
Just don’t let it get to you (or at least don’t make it sound like 
it’s gotten to you).

The point here is really just to make sure you understand 
that it’s a really annoying/painful/long process for everyone 
and you’re not alone!


//Resume Versions
If you’re applying to several different types of positions, 
tailor your resume for the specific type of opportunity. 
Just remember that, if you’re submitting it virtually, they can see the title.

It’s also important to note that if you’re not gaining traction 
getting responses with a certain resume, don’t be afraid to switch it up. 
Keep track of the changes and see which version performs better than the others.


//Cover Letters
Some positions require you to also submit cover letters. In our own experience,
however They have a magical way of getting lost or ignored. 
If someone’s spending < 10 seconds looking at your resume at first, 
why are they going to read a long cover letter?


Though they may not look at your cover letter during the first pass, 
if your resume looks interesting then the cover letter has a way of 
becoming more important. The hiring manager wants to make sure the 
story he crafted in his head is even more awesome in reality when 
hearing it from the applicant’s own words. So it’s important to not 
use meaningless buzzwords and platitudes in your cover letter but 
instead focus on providing a concise but descriptive (and specific) 
letter answering the key questions we’ve talked about before 
(are you capable and driven?).

It also needs to answer a new question that the resume doesn’t really 
address directly: “Why does this person actually want to work at MY company?”. 
That’s actually very important if it’s a startup or other strongly cultural 
organization – they’re looking for people who have a very strong reason 
for wanting to work there so they know you’ll stick around and grow 
with the company.


//Email Cover Letters
Every piece of communication you have with a company is relevant. 
The most important is the one where you first reach out via email. 
You probably want to treat that as a condensed version of a cover letter – 
express your brilliance and fit in just a few powerful sentences.

//Applying
Track every application you send out in your spreadsheet by the date you sent it. 
As we said above, you don’t need to go crazy on Day 1 but keep a regular 
flow of applications going out.

//Following up
Follow up on all applications you care about. Follow up once in 
the first few days and again after a week or two if you haven’t heard anything.

This obviously works best if you’ve identified an individual at the company before, but the point is that perseverance matters and it can help you display the kind of drive you’re trying to show in your resume anyway.

This actually applies to the whole process, not just applications. 
Follow up your interviews (with a thank you to your interviewer on day 1 too). 
Follow up your tech screens. The goal here isn’t to be naggy and 
annoying/desperate, and it’s certainly not to be a robot sending 
auto-generated emails all the time. Just be human and honest and 
simple in your language.

Handling A Job Offer

If you kicked butt, you’ll get an offer. That means there’s a pretty good 
chance you’ll get to work there, but just remember that not all “offers” 
(especially verbal-only ones) are actually real. It’s a good time to be 
happy because you did well but don’t expect that it’s a done deal.

don’t go buying a house until you’ve signed the documents. 
If it’s just a verbal offer, ask them to email you the details.

DO NOT ACCEPT RIGHT AWAY! This is doubly true if you don’t think it’s a good offer. 
This is an important point for you – they’ve been totally in control of the 
process until now and they’ve probably dragged their feet because they can 
(who knows, an even better developer might show up, right?). 
Now it’s your turn. They’ve put in a lot of effort so far and any 
reasonable company isn’t going to let you walk away over a few days or a 
few thousand dollars. They should give you at least a week to decide.

One big factor is compensation. The person making the offer usually has 
discretion to bump it up a bit (maybe $5k in Silicon Valley, probably 
less elsewhere) without asking their manager, so it’s often a good 
idea to negotiate the first offer. Maybe you’re negotiating salary, 
vacation, relocation bonuses, or personal project status. It doesn’t 
matter, your position is a whole lot better while you’re holding that offer.

What’s the best thing you can do? GET ANOTHER OFFER! There’s nothing 
nearly as good when negotiating as another offer from another company 
which gives you the ability to walk away. You shouldn’t be shamelessly 
callous and capitalistic about it (the goal isn’t to piss off everyone 
who gave you offers), but do take advantage of this!

Not only that, but remember all those companies that dragged their 
feet and you hadn’t heard back from? Send every one of them (who you 
are realistically interested in) an email explaining that you have 
an offer and need to make a decision relatively quickly. 
See if that doesn’t help them speed you along in the process and 
maybe get you that other offer. As soon as you have an offer to work with, 
you suddenly have all that social proof you never had before since 
you haven’t worked anywhere else. Use it.

Once you’ve worked through your negotiation and hopefully had the 
chance to rank multiple offers, the decision must be made. 
That’s a good choice to have to make. Congratulations! 
Now you get paid to keep learning.

Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer

how i landed a job at Airbnb
https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/


my negotiation skills are nothing special.
It just so happens that most people don’t negotiate at all, 
or if they do, they just negotiate just enough to satisfy themselves that they did.

Second: negotiation is tricky to generalize about because it’s deeply 
intertwined with social dynamics and power. The appropriate advice for 
an Asian male in Silicon Valley may not be appropriate for a black 
woman in Birmingham, Alabama. Racial, sexual, and political dynamics 
accompany you to the negotiating table.

At the same time, I want to caution against overemphasizing these factors. 
Being afraid to negotiate out of fear of discrimination can often be just 
as deleterious as discrimination itself.

Ceteris paribus, negotiate aggressively.

What you are actually doing is selling your labor, 
and a company is bidding for it.
not finding a job

Like any market, the labor market only functions well if it’s competitive. 
This is the only way to ensure fair and equitable pricing. Imagine you were 
a farmer selling watermelons. Would you just sell your watermelons to the 
first buyer who agreed to purchase them? Or would you survey the marketplace 
of buyers, see the best price (and business partner) you could get, 
and then make an informed decision on which buyer to sell to?

And yet, when people talk about the labor market, they think “oh, a company wants 
to give me a job! What a relief!” As though having a job were in itself some 
special privilege for which a company is the gatekeeper.

Dispel yourself of this mindset.

A job is just a deal. It is a deal between you and a company to exchange 
labor for money (and other things you value).


//The role of negotiation
Negotiating is a natural and expected part of the process of trying to make a deal. 
It’s also a signal of competence and seriousness. Companies generally respect 
candidates who negotiate, and most highly attractive candidates negotiate 
(if for no other reason, because they often have too many options to choose from).

At the risk of spouting truisms: always, always negotiate. Doesn’t matter 
how good or bad you think you are. You never damage a relationship by negotiating.

In all my time as an instructor at App Academy, out of hundreds of offers 
negotiated, only once or twice were offers ever rescinded in negotiations. 
It basically never happens. And when it does, usually the candidate was 
being an unconscionable asshole, or the company was imploding and needed 
an excuse to rescind the offer.


You might think to yourself: “well, I don’t want to set high expectations, and the offer is already generous, so I ought to just take it.“

No. Negotiate.

Or maybe: “I don’t want to start off on the wrong foot and look greedy 
with my future employer.“

No. Negotiate.

“But this company is small and—“

No. Shut up. Negotiate.

We’ll talk more in the next section about why a lot of these 
objections are bullshit, and fundamentally misapprehend the dynamics 
of hiring. But for now, just trust me that you should always negotiate.

The ten rules of negotiating
I’ve tried to boil down negotiation to ten rules. The rules, in order of appearance, are:

Get everything in writing
Always keep the door open
Information is power
Always be positive
Don’t be the decision maker
Have alternatives
Proclaim reasons for everything
Be motivated by more than just money
Understand what they value
Be winnable

You’ve just received the phone call: your interview went well, 
and after much deliberation they decided they like you. 
They want to make you an offer. Congratulations!

Don’t get too excited though. The fun is just getting started.


Thank your recruiter. Sound excited—hopefully this won’t be hard. 
Before jumping into details, try to ask for specific feedback on your 
interview performance. If they give it to you, this will help you 
gauge how much they want you, as well as tell you things you can 
improve on in your next interview(s).

Now time to explore the offer.


Rule #1 of negotiating: have everything in writing.
write the offer down 
if anything relate to the job
write it down
if they say they have 20 employees, write it down anything
will be important in informing your final decision

Often, the company won’t even send you an official offer letter until a 
deal is finalized. So it falls to you to confirm all of the important 
details in subsequent e-mails.

Your recruiter will now say something along the lines of “so what do you think?“
this is your decision point
want to compel you to make a decision
if they succeed in trying you, they will close the door for future negotiations
it is the beginning of many attempts to get you to make a premature commitment.



This leads to rule #2 of negotiating: always keep the door open. 
Never give up your negotiating power until you’re absolutely ready 
to make an informed, deliberate final decision.

Very frequently, your interlocutor will try to trick you into making a decision, 
or tie you to a decision you didn’t commit to. You must keep verbally 
jiu-jitsu-ing out of these antics until you’re actually ready to make your 
final decision.


////Protecting information
There’s an uncomfortable silence by now, and their “what do you think?” is hanging 
in the air.

yes, that sounds amazing, when do I start?
“can you do 90K instead of 85K?”
this is what they want to hear and will close the door for negotiations

they wont give info about how much they can actually or do pay
but will want to know what else can be offered and bit just a bit more than it

In many situations, the only reason why you have any negotiating power at all 
is because the employer doesn’t actually know what you’re thinking. 
They might not know how good your other offers are, or how much you were making 
in your last job, or how you weigh salary vs equity, or even how rational you 
are as a decision-maker. Bottom line, you want them to be uncertain on exactly 
what it would take to sign you.

When you say “can you do 90K instead of 85K,” you’ve told them exactly what 
it will take to make you sign. The sheet’s pulled back, the secret auction is 
up, and they’re going to bid 90K (or more likely, 87K). And they know there’s 
almost no risk in doing so, because you’ll probably accept.

What if you were the kind of person who wouldn’t even consider an offer below 110K? 
Or the kind of person who wouldn’t consider an offer below 120K? 
If you were, you wouldn’t ask for 90K, and if they offered it as conciliation, 
you’d tell them to stop wasting your time.

By staying silent, they don’t actually know which of those kinds of people you are. 
In their mind, you could be any of the three.

A corollary of this rule is that you should not reveal to companies 
what you’re currently making. There are some exceptions, but as a rule 
you should assume this.

Companies will ask about your current compensation at different stages in 
the process—some before they ever interview you, some after they decide to 
make you an offer. But be mindful of this, and protect information.

So given this offer, don’t ask for more money or equity or anything of the sort. 
Don’t comment on any specific details of the offer except to clarify them.

Give away nothing. Retain your power.

Say instead: “Yeah, [COMPANY_NAME] sounds great! I really thought this was a good 
fit, and I’m glad that you guys agree. Right now I’m talking with a few other 
companies so I can’t speak to the specific details of the offer until I’m done 
with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I’m sure we’ll be 
able to find a package that we’re both happy with, because I really would 
love to be a part of the team.“

Cool. It’s a big market, and you’re patient—you’re a farmer after all. Just smile and tell them you’ll keep their offer in mind.

And this is super important: always be unequivocally positive.


////The importance of positivity
Staying positive is rule #4 of negotiation. Even if the offer is shit, 
it’s extremely important to remain positive and excited about the company. 
This is because your excitement is one of your most valuable assets in a 
negotiation.

A company is making you an offer because they think you’ll do hard work for them 
if they pay you. If you lose your excitement for the company during the interview 
process, then they’ll lose confidence that you’ll actually want to work hard or 
stay there for a long time. Each of those makes you less attractive as an 
investment. Remember, you are the product! If you become less excited, 
then the product you’re selling actually loses value.

So despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the 
impression that 1) you still like the company, and that 2) you’re still 
excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is 
not working out. Generally the most convincing thing to signal this is 
to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they’re working on, 
and really want to see things work out.


////Don’t be the decision-maker
You can wrap up the conversation now by saying:

I’ll look over some of these details and discuss it with my 
[FAMILY/CLOSE_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT_OTHER]. I’ll reach out to you if 
I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, 
and I’ll be in touch!

Rule #5 of negotiation: don’t be the decision-maker.
There’s no point in them trying to bully and intimidate you; the 
“true decision-maker” is beyond their reach.
It’s not their decision to make. This helps to defuse tension and give them more control of the situation.

We have our first offer. Send a follow-up e-mail confirming all of the 
details you discussed with your recruiter so you have a paper trail. 
Just say “just wanted to confirm I had all the details right.“

Groovy. Next step is to leverage this to land other offers and find the best 
deal we can find in the job market.


////Getting other offers
Turns out, it doesn’t matter that much where your first offer is from, 
or even how much they’re offering you. Just having an offer in hand will 
get the engine running.

If you’re already in the pipeline with other companies (which you should 
be if you’re doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let 
them know that you’ve just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency. 
Regardless of whether you know the expiration date, all offers expire at some 
point, so take advantage of that.

Hello [PERSON],

I just wanted to update you on my own process. I’ve just received an offer 
from [COMPANY] which is quite strong. That said, I’m really excited about 
[YOUR AMAZING COMPANY] and really want to see if we can make it work. 
Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to 
expedite the process?


Should you specifically mention the company that gave you an offer? Depends. 
If it’s a well-known company or a competitor, then definitely mention it. 
If it’s a no-name or unattractive company, you should just say you received an offer. 
If it’s expiring soon, you should mention that as well.

show that supplies are limited and build urgency. Demand breeds demand. 
Not every company will respond to this, but many will.


////Why companies care about other offers
A company’s goal is to hire someone who will become an effective 
employee and produce more value than their cost. How do you figure 
out who will do that? Well, you can’t know for certain without actually 
hiring them, but there are a few proxies. Pedigree is the strongest signal; 
if they did it at other companies, they can probably do it at yours. 
And if someone trusted within the organization can vouch for them, 
that’s often a strong signal as well.

Interviews, if you think about it, are long, sweaty, uncomfortable affairs 
that only glancingly resemble actual employment. They’re weird and can’t 
tell you that much about whether an individual will be a good at their job. 


They care because each company knows that their own process is noisy, 
and the processes of most other companies are also noisy.

But caring about whether you have other offers and valuing you accordingly 
is completely rational.


As you continue interviewing, remember to keep practicing your interview skills. 
The single strongest determinant of your final offer will be the number 
and strength of offers that you receive.


////Some advice on timing
You want to be strategic about the timing of your offers. Generally, 
you should try to start interviewing at larger companies earlier. 
Their processes are slower and their offer windows are wider (meaning 
they allow you more time to decide). Startups are the other way around.

Your goal should be to have as many offers overlapping at the same time 
as possible. This will maximize your window for negotiating.

When you receive an offer, often the first thing you should ask for is 
more time to make your decision. Especially in your first offer, more 
time is by far the most valuable thing you can ask for. It’s time that 
enables you to activate other companies and end up with the strongest 
possible offer. So be prepared to fight for time.

It’s time that enables you to activate other companies and end up

////How to approach exploding offers
Exploding offers are offers that expire within 24-72 hours. 
You won’t see this much at big companies, but they’re becoming 
increasingly common among startups and mid-sized companies.

Exploding offers are a natural weapon for employers to combat a strong 
hiring market for tech workers. Companies know exactly what they’re doing 
with exploding offers—they play on fear and limit your ability to seek out 
counteroffers.

 Employers often justify this by saying “If you need more time than this, 
 then that’s a sign you’re not the kind of person we’re looking for.“

Please don’t buy this crap or feel guilty over it. They’re simply doing 
this to improve their chance of closing candidates. 
Needing more than three days to make a life decision isn’t a 
sign of anything other than thoughtfulness.

Exploding offers are anathema to your ability to effectively navigate the 
labor market. Thus, there is only one thing to do. Treat the offer as a 
non-offer unless the expiration window is widened.

In no uncertain terms, convey that if the offer is exploding, it’s useless to you.

"I have one big concern. You mentioned that this offer explodes in 48 hours.
I’m afraid this doesn’t work at all for me. There’s no way that I can make a 
decision on this offer within a 48 hour window. I’m currently wrapping up my 
interview process at a few other companies, which is likely to take me 
another week or so. So I’m going to need more time to make an informed decision."

If they push back and say this is the best they can do, then politely reply:

"That’s really unfortunate. I like [YOUR COMPANY] and was really excited 
about the team, but like I said, there’s no way I can consider this offer. 
48 hours just too unreasonable of a window. The next company I join will 
be a big life decision for me, and I take my commitments very seriously. 
I also need to consult with my [EXTERNAL_DECISION_MAKER]. 
There’s no way that I can make a decision I’m comfortable with in 
this short an amount of time."

Pretty much any company will relent at this point. If they persist, 
don’t be afraid to walk away over it. (They probably won’t let that happen, 
and will come grab you as you’re walking out the door. But if they don’t, 
then honestly, screw ‘em.)

I was given several exploding offers during my job search. And every time, 
I did essentially this. Every single offer immediately widened to become 
more reasonable, sometimes by several weeks.


////The Negotiating Mindset
think multi dimensional
don’t just value companies based on salary, equity, or even on prestige. 
Those are all important dimensions, but so are cultural fit, the challenge 
of the work, learning potential, later career options, quality of life, 
growth potential, and just overall happiness. None of these inherently 
trump any of the other. 

Be open to being surprised as you explore different companies.

It’s also important to understand that companies don’t all value you 
along the same dimension either.

The more companies you talk to, the more likely you are to find a company 
to which you are significantly more valuable than the rest.

It might surprise you which company this turns out to be; keep an open mind, 
and remember that a job search is a 2-sided process.

One of the most valuable things you can do for yourself in this process is 
to really try to understand how employers think and what motivates them.

But most of all I want to emphasize: be curious about the other side. 
Try to understand why employers think the way they do. Be sympathetic 
toward them. Care about what they want and help them try to get it. 
Adopting this mindset will make you a much stronger negotiator, 
and accordingly, a much better employee and team member.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


//////How Not to Bomb Your Offer Negotiation

You’ve maneuvered through the initial offer conversation, 
you’ve lined up counteroffers from other companies, 
and now it’s time to move into the actual negotiating.

Naturally, this is the part where everything goes horribly wrong.

A good negotiator is empathetic and collaborative. 
They don’t try to control you or issue ultimatums. Rather, 
they try to think creatively about how to fulfill both your and their needs.

Think more like negotiating dinner plans with a group of friends, 
and you’ll fare much better.

//////Slicing up the cake
But this is exactly what good negotiators do. They bend the rules. 
They question assumptions and ask unexpected questions. 
They dig to find the core what everyone values and looks 
for creative ways to widen the terrain of negotiation.

While you were thinking about how to haggle over slices, 
I’m thinking about how to give both of us more than just half of a cake.

We may value the same things—we both care about cake, after all. 
But we we don’t value them in exactly the same way, so there’s probably 
a way to give each of us more of what we want.

Most people go into a job negotiation thinking they need to stubbornly 
haggle over salary like slices of cake. They don’t ever stop to ask—hey, 
what do I actually value? Why do I value it? What does the company value? 
Why do they value that?

There are many dimensions in a job negotiation: salary, signing bonus, 
stock, a year-end or performance bonus, commuter benefits, relocation expenses, 
equipment, an educational stipend, a childcare stipend, extra vacation time, 
a later start date, getting a dedicated hour a day to work out or study or 
meditate or play solitaire. You could choose which team you’re assigned to, 
what your first project will be, what technologies you’ll be working with, 
and sometimes even choose your title.

Maybe you’re a frosting person, and the company is more into cherries. 
You never know if you don’t ask.

Hold onto this mindset.

Let’s pick up the negotiation where we left off. All the offers are in, 
and recruiters are eagerly awaiting for you to get the ball rolling.

Let’s start negotiating.

//////Phone vs Email

Talking on the phone not only signals confidence, but more importantly, 
it allows you to build a strong relationship with your recruiter.

Talking on the phone enables bantering, telling jokes, and building connection. 
You want your recruiter to like you, understand you, empathize with you, 
and want you to succeed. Likewise, you want to care about your recruiter 
and understand what’s motivating them.

The best deals get made between friends. It’s hard to make friends over e-mail.

They’re also well aware that negotiating is easier over e-mail, 
and they have little interest in making it easier on you. 
They’ll often be vague about the offer over e-mail and only 
offer to discuss specific details on the phone.

If you want to stick to email, you have to push back against this. 
There’s no secret to it: just be honest and ask for what you want.

Hi recruiter, I hope your day is treating you well!

Re: your previous e-mail, I’d prefer to discuss the details of the offer 
over e-mail. I sometimes get nervous during important phone calls, 
so discussing the offer over e-mail helps me to keep a clear head and 
communicate more clearly. I hope this is okay with you. :)

No bullshit, no huff-puffery. Just telling the truth and asking for what you want.

There’s tremendous power in honesty and directness. Take advantage of it.

(Also, note how I wrote “discuss the details of the offer” rather than “negotiate.



//////Having Alternatives

With other offers on the table, if your negotiation doesn’t work out, 
they know you’ll just accept another offer. Your negotiating position 
suddenly becomes a lot more credible because they know you’re willing to walk away.

This effect is strengthened if you get an offer from a prestigious company. 
And the effect goes through the roof if you have an offer from a company’s 
primary competitor (now they’ll really want to poach you from the big bad 
competitor-corp).

But what if you don’t manage to get any other offers? Does all the negotiating just go out the window?

Not at all. What’s important here is not actually having other offers. 
More specifically, it’s in having strong alternatives.

A negotiation needs stakes. If there were no risk and you knew for sure the other side would sign a contract, what incentive would you have to offer them anything more?

Your alternatives are what give a negotiation its stakes. 
By signaling your alternatives, you allow your interlocutor to develop a 
mental model of when and why you’ll walk away from the negotiation. 
Your alternatives also have an anchoring effect on how much the other 
side thinks you’re objectively worth.

In negotiation literature, your best alternative is often referred to 
as your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). 
Basically, it’s what you’d do if you walked away.

Your best alternative might be “interview at more companies” or “go to grad school”

The point is, you don’t need to have another offer to have a strong BATNA. 
Your BATNA’s strength comes from 1) how strong the other side perceives 
it to be, and 2) how strong you perceive it to be.

If your recruiter thinks that going to grad school is an awesome thing to do, 
then they’ll see you as having a very strong alternative, 
and the stakes of the negotiation will be raised.

But even if they think grad school is ridiculous, if you convince them that 
you’d be totally happy to go to grad school, 
then the burden is on them to make this deal more attractive 
to you than going to grad school.

Thus, you need to communicate your BATNA. This doesn’t need to be ham-fisted, 
but you need to make it a background to the negotiation. 
(Note: usually whenever you signal your BATNA, you should also 
re-emphasize your interest in reaching an agreement).

"I’ve received another offer from [OTHER CORP] that’s very compelling on salary, 
but I really love the mission of [YOUR COMPANY] and think that it would overall 
be a better fit for me.

I’m also considering going back to grad school and getting a Master’s degree 
in Postmodern Haberdashery. I’m excited about [YOUR COMPANY] though and would 
love to join the team, but the package has to make sense if I’m going to 
forego a life of ironic hatmaking."


If you already have a job, staying where you are is often your BATNA.

This means if you tell your interlocutor that you hate your job, 
then they know your BATNA sucks, and have no incentive to negotiate 
with you (on top of potentially thinking that you’re a negative person). 
Always emphasize the pros of your current company, your seniority, 
your impact, and whatever else you like about where you currently work.

You should make your decision seem genuinely close for it to be a strong BATNA.


//////What a Job Negotiation Means to an Employer
First, we have to rewind and understand what brought us to this offer in the first place. What kind of resources have they spent so far in trying to fill this position?

Writing and posting a job description on all appropriate channels ($300)
Reviewing ~100 or more resumes ($1250)

About 15% of those resumes need to be phone screened, so roughly 15 phone 
screens ($2250)

Around 75% of those initial phone screens warrant a technical screen, 
so roughly 11 technical screens ($9000)

About 30% pass through to an on-site, so roughly 3 onsites. 
These onsites require the coordination of 6-7 employees ($10800)

Finally, they make one offer. The recruiter (and potentially 
the executive staff) need to spend time on the phone with the 
offeree convincing and negotiating. ($900)

All-in-all this process took about 45 days from start to finish.

Now say you end up turning down their offer. 
They’ve spent over $24,000 just extending this single offer 
to you (to say nothing of opportunity costs), and now they’ll 
essentially have to start over from scratch.

This is what a company faces if you turn them down.

Realize what a gauntlet they’ve been through!

Realize how important it is that you’re the one!

Out of the droves and droves who’ve shown up on their doorstep, 
you’re the one they want. They want to usher you into their tribe. 
They went through so much crap to get you here, and now they’ve found you.

And you’re worried that if you negotiate, they’ll take it away?

Further yet, understand that salary is only one part of the cost of 
employing you. An employer also has to pay for your benefits, 
your equipment, space, utilities, other random expenses, 
and employment taxes on top of all of that. 
All-in, your actual salary often comprises less than 
50% of the total cost of employing you.
http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/pdf/how-much-does-an-employee-cost.pdf


(Which means they expect that your value to the company, 
in terms of the revenue you’ll generate, to be more than 2x your salary. 
If they didn’t believe that, they wouldn’t be hiring you at all.)

So, this is all to say: everything is stacked in your favor. 
It doesn’t feel that way, but it absolutely is.

Realize that when you are agonizing over whether to ask for another few 
thousand dollars, what they’re doing is praying with bated breath that 
you’ll sign the offer.

If you don’t sign the offer, they lose. Losing a good candidate sucks. 
No one wants to believe that their company isn’t worth working for.

They want to win. They will pay to win.

And yet, you might worry: “but if end up negotiating more, won’t 
they have higher expectations? Won’t my boss end up hating me for negotiating?”

No, and no.

It’s your role that will determine your performance expectations, 
not how much you negotiated. Making 5k more or less in salary doesn’t 
matter at all. Your manager will literally just not care about this.

Remember how expensive it is to even employ you in the first place! Nobody’s 
going to fire you because you’re performing 5K worse than they expected you to; 
the cost of firing you and hiring someone else is a lot more than 5K to begin 
with.

And no, your boss won’t hate you now. And in fact, at most big companies 
the person you’re negotiating with won’t even be your boss. 
Recruiting and management are totally separate departments, 
completely abstracted from one another. And even if you’re at a startup, 
trust me that your boss is used to negotiating with candidates and 
doesn’t put nearly as much significance in it as you do.

In short: negotiating is easier and more normal than you think, 
and companies are completely willing to negotiate with you. 
If your intuition tells you otherwise, trust that your mental model is wrong.




//////How to Give the First Number
In part 1, I mentioned how valuable it is not to have to give the first number. 
But there are times when you can’t avoid it. In that case, there are ways to 
give the first number without giving the first number.

If a company asks you “what are your salary expectations?” you might say:

I don’t have any particular numbers in mind. I’m more interested in 
learning whether this will be a good mutual fit. If it is, I’m open to 
exploring any offer so long as it’s competitive.

Sounds good. But they push back,

I understand that, but we need to have a clear idea of what you 
think is competitive. I need to know whether it’s worth going 
through the interview process. We’re a young startup, 
so I need to make sure we’re on the same page as far as compensation.

That’s a strong push. But you can still push back.

I completely hear you, and I agree it’s important that we’re on 
the same page. I really have no particular numbers in my head, it 
all depends on the fit and the composition of the offer. Once we decide 
we want to work together, I think that’s the best time to figure out a 
compensation package that makes sense.

Most employers will relent here. But there’s a small chance they push further:

Okay, look, you’re being difficult. Let’s not waste each other’s time. 
What’s an offer that you’d be willing to take?

This is a decision point. They’re trying to take away your negotiating 
power and pin you to a premature decision.

That said, you probably will have to say a number at this point, or 
risk damaging the trust in this relationship. (They are making a valid point 
that startups can’t offer the same kind of cash as large companies, 
nor should you expect them to. They might be sensing that you’re not 
aware of this.)

But you can give a number here without actually giving a number.

Well, okay. I know that the average software engineer in Silicon Valley makes 
roughly 120K a year salary. So I think that’s a good place to start.

Notice what I did here. I didn’t actually answer the question “what’s an 
offer you’d be willing to take,” I merely anchored the conversation 
around the fulcrum of “the average software engineer salary.”

So if you’re forced to give a number, do so by appealing to an 
objective metric, such as an industry average (or your current salary). 
And make it clear that you’re merely starting the negotiation there, not ending it.



//////How to Ask for More
Say an offer is out there, and now you want to improve it. 
As always, be direct and ask for what you want. 

Here are generally the steps you should take.

First, reiterate your interest in the company. This is as simple as:
I’m really excited about the problems you guys are working on at Evil Corp…

Now frame why you’re asking for more. There are two choices here: 
you can say that you’re on the fence and that an improvement might 
convince you, or you can go stronger and say that you’re outright 
dissatisfied with the offer. Which approach you choose depends on 
how much leverage you have, how weak the offer is relative to your BATNA, 
and whether you have other offers (the weaker your negotiating position, 
generally the more tentative you should be).

Either way, be unfailingly polite.

If you’re dissatisfied with the offer, you might say something like:

I appreciate the work you guys put into constructing this offer. 
But there were a couple things I was unsatisfied with.

If you want to be more reserved, you can say something like:
The offer you guys extended was strong. Right now my decision is 
basically between you and [XYZ CORP]. 
It’s a genuinely difficult decision for me, but there are a couple 
of dimensions where, if this offer improved, it would be much more compelling.

Don’t just say something like:
Thanks for the offer. Here are some ways I think it could improve.

This makes you sound like an ass. Be polite, and if you want to 
strengthen the offer, tell them clearly how you feel about it. This builds 
trust and conveys seriousness.


Let’s say you want to raise the salary. Now that you have a specific ask, 
it’s time to employ rule #7: proclaim reasons for everything.

We all implicitly know the catch-22 of negotiation: if you say you want 
more salary, you’ll sound greedy. And no one likes greedy people, right? 
So why would they want to give more money to a greedy person?

If you had to raise your salary or you wouldn’t be able to afford rent, 
or if you had to negotiate health insurance to cover a medical condition, 
you’d negotiate without a twinge of regret. The difference? 
That you have a reason for what you’re requesting.

It’s kind of a brain-hack, both for yourself and for your negotiating partner. 
Just stating a reason—any reason—makes your request feel human and important. 
It’s not you being greedy, it’s you trying to fulfill your goals.

The more unobjectionable and sympathetic your reason, the better. 
If it’s medical expenses, or paying off student loans, 
or taking care of family, you’ll bring tears to their eyes. 
I told employers that I was earning-to-give, so since 
I was donating 33% of my income to charity, I had negotiate 
aggressively to leave myself enough to live off.

But honestly, even if your reason is inane and unimpressive, 
it will still carry this effect.

Just saying “can you improve the salary?” sounds like you’re boringly 
motivated by money. But if you say “I really want to buy a house within 
the next year; what can we do to improve the salary?” this suddenly 
seems a lot more legitimate.

If they turn down your request now, they’re implicitly telling you “no Jennifer, 
you can’t buy your house. I guess you don’t deserve one.” No one wants to do that. 
They want to be the one who says “Alright Jennifer, I talked with the director 
and I made it happen. You’re getting that new house!”

Of course, it goes without saying that the reason you want money is 
so that you can spend it on things. What do they think you’re going 
to use it for, toilet paper?

I know. It’s stupid. It’s really stupid, but it works.

Just go with it, state a reason for everything, and you’ll 
find recruiters more willing to become your advocate.


//////Assert your Value
One effective move you can make in a negotiation, especially after an ask, 
is to emphasize the unique value you’ll be bringing to the company. Example:

Blah blah blah, I want X, Y, and Z.
I know that you guys are looking for someone to build out your Android team. 
I believe I bring a lot of experience leading a team of Android developers 
and I’m confident that I’ll be able to bring your mobile offerings up to 
parity with your competitors.
Let me know your thoughts.

This is not appropriate in every negotiation, especially for very junior 
positions, where it’s harder to differentiate yourself. But later 
in your career (or for more specialized/consulting roles) this can 
be a really valuable nudge.


//////What to Ask For
rule #8: be motivated by more than just money.

There is no bigger turn-off to a company than somebody who only 
cares about money. This is something you’re not going to be able to fake.

Actually be motivated by other things. 
You should be motivated by money too of course, 
but it should be one among many dimensions you’re optimizing for. 
How much training you get, what your first project will be, 
which team you join, or even who your mentor will be—these are 
all things you can and should negotiate.

Among these factors, salary is perhaps the least important.

What do you really value? Be creative. Don’t try to haggle over 
slices of cake when there’s so much more on the table.

Of course, to negotiate well you need to understand the other side’s preferences. 
You want to make the deal better for both of you. 
That’s why rule #9 is: understand what the company values.

First, salary is almost always the hardest thing to give, for a few reasons.
It must be paid year after year, so it becomes part of a company’s long-term 
burn rate.
It is almost always the thing that people gossip about, so paying someone 
significantly more salary can cause unrest.
It tends to be the most tightly constrained by pay bands, 
especially at large companies.



//////A Brief Primer on Equity
//////Equity Shenanigans
A job is not a suicide pact. Choose a company that is judicious and 
transparent, and you’ll be much more likely to find yourself 
respected and taken care of.

//////Other Things You Can Ask For
Recruiters love trying to trick you into ending the negotiation early. 
They’re going to do this relentlessly. Don’t fault them for it—I suspect 
they can’t help themselves.

Just keep breaking out of their shenanigans, and don’t let yourself 
be pressured into ending a negotiation until you’re actually ready 
to make a final decision. This is especially grave if you have multiple offers, 
and you let one company pressure you into canceling the others.

Situation 1:
I ask for a 10K increase in signing bonus. The company gets back to me and says,

That’s really tough for us to do. I’m going to try, I think you’re worth it, 
but I can’t really go to my boss and fight for you unless she knows you’re 
going to sign. Are you going to sign if I get you that 10K?

You should be thinking: ah, this person is trying to force me to a 
decision point and take away my negotiating power.

I respond:
Okay, so what I’m hearing is that you’ll have to expend some personal 
reputation to get me a 10K bonus. If you end up going to bat for me, 
are you confident you’ll be able to get that 10K?

They respond:
I think I can, it just comes down to you Haseeb. If you’re serious 
about joining us, then I’ll go fight for you. But I need to know for 
sure you’ll sign.

Great. Time to Jiu Jitsu.
That makes sense. Unfortunately I can’t commit to signing yet; 
I’m not yet at the stage where I can make a final decision. 
Like I told you before, this weekend I’m going to sit down with my 
family and talk things over with them. Choosing the company I’m going 
to spend the next few years at is a commitment I take really seriously, 
and so I want to be sure I’m making a well-considered decision.

But since you’re confident that you can get an extra 10K, 
let’s do this instead: in my mind, I’ll pretend this offer is [X + 10K] 
and as I’m considering my final decision, that’s where I’ll value it. 
I know it’s tough for you to go and get that from your boss, 
so I don’t want you to do that until I’m certain I’m going to sign.

They then vaguely recant and promptly get approval for the 10K bonus.


Situation 2:
I ask for a 20% increase in stock package. The hiring manager, 
knowing that I’m negotiating with other companies, then fires back:

I want to get this stock package for you. And I know I can, we’ve got the budget. 
But before I do that, I need your word on something.

What’s that?
I need you to give me your word that if I improve your offer, 
you’re not going to just turn around and take our counter-offer to 
[COMPETITOR_COMPANY] to improve your offer with them.

You should be thinking: so basically they’re asking me not to negotiate. Cute.

Let me see if I understand what you’re saying. You are willing to 
improve my offer, but only if I agree that I won’t tell [COMPETITOR] 
what you’re offering me. Is that correct?

Well no, I can’t legally do that. What I mean is…what I mean is, look. 
I like you. But if I improve your offer and you just take our offer 
to [COMPETITOR], you’ll be violating my trust.

Okay, let me be sure I understand you here. If you give me this offer 
and I tell [COMPETITOR], I will be violating the trust under which 
you’re granting me this improved offer. Is that correct?

Uhh…Look. How about this. In my mind, I’m going to go get you this 
stock package okay? And in my head, I’m going to do it with the 
assumption that you’re the kind of person I think you are, 
and you’re going to consider our offer in its own right and not
just shop it around. Fair enough?

I nod. He gets the improved offer. I continue to negotiate. Antics averted.

(In case you’re wondering, if he had said “yes,” I would have 
turned down the proposal.)


//////The Path to Signing
It’s not enough to just continually ask for stuff. 
Companies need to sense that you’re actually moving 
toward a final decision, and not just playing games with them.

Your goal in a negotiation is not to be difficult or elusive. 
True, you should assert your value and carefully consider your options, 
but you can do so in a way that’s respectful and considerate toward 
the companies you’re talking to.

Don’t go dark on people. Be open and communicative. 
I keep saying be honest and I mean it—be honest.

you should protect information that might weaken your negotiating position, 
but you should be as communicative as possible about everything else 
(which is most things).

Negotiating is all about relationship, and communication is the 
bedrock of any relationship.

the final rule: be winnable. This is more than just giving the company 
the impression that you like them (which you continually should). 
But more so that you must give any company you’re talking to a 
clear path on how to win you. Don’t bullshit them or play stupid games. 
Be clear and unequivocal with your preferences and timeline.

If there is nothing that a company could do to sign you, or you don’t 
actually want to work for them, then don’t negotiate with them. Period.


//////Making the Final Decision
Three things to keep in mind here:

Be clear about your deadline.
Assert your deadline continually.
Use your final decision as your trump card.

just pre-committing to a deadline will allow you to negotiate more clearly and powerfully.

“A weekend with the family.” I found works nicely, as it has the added benefit 
of roping other decision makers in. Then when companies push you to end 
negotiations early, you can re-assert this deadline.

This deadline also lets you defer your decision while still improving offers. 
Your narrative should basically be “I want to see the strongest offer your 
company can muster. Then I will go into my cave, meditate for 10 days, 
and when I emerge I will have decided in my heart which company to join.” 
This gives you enormous power to avoid any on-the-spot decision points or 
premature promises.

Even if there’s only one company in the running, you should always 
always wait until the last day to sign your offer. Yes, even if you’re 
certain you’re going to sign and even if it’s your dream job.

Every company that’s still on the table, let them know what it would take 
to sign you (unless there’s nothing they could do). And when you make the 
final ask, don’t forget reason-giving, even if it’s the same reason as before!

Hi Joel, I’ve been thinking it over and it’s genuinely a really tough 
decision for me. I loved everyone at [COMPANY] but the one thing that 
makes it hard for me is the salary. As you know I’m trying to pay 
off my student loans so salary is really important to me right now. 
If you can improve the salary by 10K a year, then I’ll be totally ready to sign.

And just because I know someone will ask—yes, once say you’re going to sign, 
you should always sign. Never go back on your word. It’s a small world, 
people talk, and these kind of things will come back to haunt you. 
(More importantly, never go back on your word because you’re the 
kind of person who never goes back on their word.)

Tell all of the other parties that you’ve made your final decision. 
Thank them for the negotiation. If you did it well, 
they’ll usually thank you back, tell you to keep in touch, and 
to reach out again in a couple years next time you’re on the market.



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I was extremely fortunate that the first startup job offer 
I received was from a pair of founders who had the utmost integrity 
and explained things very clearly. Since then I’ve learned that not 
every employee is so lucky.


Salary
One of the biggest myths that I’d heard while tucked away in my 
big company cubicle was that in order to get into the startup game, 
you had to take a substantial paycut. This is false, especially 
if you’re a developer in today’s funding climate. VC funded startups 
pay very close to market rate salaries. Your ask should be the same number 
it would be at a more established company with hundreds or thousands of people.


If you join a seed stage company, you should expect to work for less 
than a market rate salary until a larger round is raised. You should 
be compensated for this with increased equity.

My recommendation is to have something written that states what market 
rate would be for you right now. This way, if it takes two years to 
raise a Series A and you’ve grown into a bigger role during that time, 
you aren’t boxed into a number that you arrived at two years earlier 
and whose value you’ve surpassed, but you do have a quantitative starting 
point for determining what your salary will be.

Whatever agreement you come to, make sure you get it in writing. 
This protects both parties and ensures that everybody leaves the 
conversation with the same impression. It’s easy to fight over what 
was said but hard to fight over what was written.

Startups do not typically offer cash bonuses unless they are generating 
substantial revenues.1 For unprofitable companies with limited runway, 
it is much better for everybody that the company provides monthly 
compensation without accruing variable costs of ~10% of annual 
payroll every year. It’s easier on the books and it prevents the company 
from setting expectations that it may be unable to meet. 
Though your cash compensation will likely be comprised only of salary; 
you can certainly use a bonus you’d earn elsewhere as leverage during negotiations.


//////Equity
Four years ago, a company offered you 0.5% of it to join as a seed stage engineer. 
The company has now raised a Series B, and you’re ready to take your shares 
and move on.

Not so fast.

First, the company didn’t really give you 0.5% of it. It gave you the 
option to buy 0.5% of it at some discount from its seed stage valuation 
(when you joined). Let’s say that discount was 70% and that valuation was $5M, 
so you have the option to buy 0.5% ($25k) of it at a 70% discount of $7,500. 
You decide you’ll just wait until it sells or goes public, 
then buy your shares for $7,500 and then sell them at market price.

Leaving the company invokes your exit clause, which stipulates that 
you have 90 days to purchase your options, or else you completely forfeit them. 
The company is not obligated to remind you of this. If you forget to exercise 
your options during this period, they’re gone. If you don’t have $7,500 to 
spare during this period, they’re gone. Your only option is to cough up 
$7,500 or relinquish all of the equity you were told you’d been “given.”


//////Starting Simple: How Does Equity Work?
Equity is given in the form of stock options. Stock options are not gifts; 
rather they are “options” to buy some amount of stock at a fixed, usually 
discounted price. The nice thing about this system is that, at least in the 
ideal case, you don’t need to buy the options until you are ready to sell them.


Though it’s tempting, if you’re a startup employee I caution you not to 
think about equity in such absolute terms, as they are difficult to predict. 
Look at your equity as a great bonus if things go well. The sad truth is that 
an overwhelming majority of startups fail, so for the sake of personal 
financial planning, assume it will amount to nothing. In the best case 
scenario it will buy you a nice car or provide a down payment on a home. 
It’s not a ticket to establishing independent wealth or never having to work again.


//////Will I get more equity after I join?
There are a few situations after joining when you may be granted additional 
equity: first, as new shares are issued, you may be allotted some of them 
to avoid dilution; second, equity is sometimes used as a performance bonus, 
especially when companies don’t have enough revenue to provide extra cash; 
third, equity is often granted as compensation for a promotion.

//////Vesting Schedules
Do not listen to any hiring manager who tells you that in order to protect 
the company, you need to work for a while before you’ll receive any equity.3 
There is a process called “vesting” that takes care of this and any founder 
who is both honest and knowledgable uses it.

Vesting is great because it protects everybody. Employees know exactly what 
they will get if they put in their time, and companies avoid the risk of an 
employee who takes equity and runs away with it.


//////Trading Salary for Equity: Do the Math
Some employers talk about equity and salary as dials that you can adjust, 
increasing one while decreasing the other. Since startups are strapped for 
cash, this is almost always presented as the employee giving up some salary 
in exchange for more equity.

Sometimes these deals are fair, and sometimes they’re not. 
What makes them difficult and often unfair for the employee is that 
there are a handful of existential disadvantages that come along with 
taking equity as a substitute for salary.

Stock options are a one-time grant, so you’re accepting one-time compensation 
in exchange for recurring compensation.

Company valuations are monopoly money until their stock becomes liquid. 
Having $200,000 in stock options doesn’t mean anything if you can’t sell 
your stock, and you can’t sell your stock unless your company goes public 
or you find a private buyer in a secondary market, which won’t happen 
unless your company is far down its path to a successful exit.

Betting on equity should imply that you believe in the vision of the company 
and that you have immense faith in the people you’re working with. 
At the end of the day, those things will impact how much your equity is 
worth more than any of the aforementioned advice.

Preparing to interview and interviewing

Interviewing is right up there with public speaking in the hierarchy of 
fears for most people. Not only are you performing for someone else but they’re 
actively judging you the whole time…

treat the interviews as a chance to show off the cool stuff you’ve built 
and the interesting new skills you’ve learned. The best interviews are 
enthusiastic conversations with technical depth.

The first step before everything is to prepare. You’ll want to figure 
out the questions you might expect to be asked (and the general responses 
you’ll have for each which demonstrate your brilliance) and you’ll want to 
research the company too. Your knowledge of the company will help you tailor 
your pitch to their needs and also allow you to ask intelligent questions 
about their product and technology when the time comes.


the process a typical tech company will go through when hiring developers:

Phone Screen
Technical Interview
Technical Challenge
Fit Interviews
Job Offer
Offer Negotiation
Offer Acceptance

//////The Phone Screen
The real purpose of this screen, which is often roughly a half hour with someone 
from Human Resources (not the actual hiring manager), is to make sure you’ve 
got a good chance of passing their technical interview and fit interviews. 
So consider it a light version of each of these.

You’ll probably be asked about some of the technical things you’ve listed on 
your resume but not actually dive into the depths (though some places do a brain 
teaser too) and you’ll probably be asked some more “softer” questions about 
why you chose the job and what you’ve done before. 

The basic tactic here isn’t a tactic – be honest and enthusiastic and open. 
And don’t be afraid to practice talking about yourself in front of the mirror.

many companies skip the light stuff and dive right into a technical screen 
so you’ve got to be prepared just in case

Mastering the Telephone Interview

Telephone interviews are a way for companies to quickly determine which 
candidates warrant more time, attention and consideration.

Step 1. Be on time
Step 2. Select a quiet place and use a land line if possible

Step 3. Do your homework.
Study the job description and the company website. 
Anticipate questions; write them down along with your answers. 
Have your resume, your questions and a pad of paper in front of you during 
the interview. Write the names of the interview panel down as they introduce 
themselves to you.

Step 4. Smile, 
maybe stand-up if it will help you transfer more energy

Step 5 Listens
Step 6. Speak Clearly
not speak at the same time, give room

Step 7. Follow up
It is important to send a follow-up note or e-mail to each person on 
the telephone interview panel as soon as the interview is over. 
You’ll need to collect the contact information and titles for the interviewers.



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The best phone screen article you'll ever find is Steve Yegge's Five 
Essential Phone-Screen Questions,

Don't let the candidate drive the interview. The interviewer should do most 
of the talking, guiding the conversation along until they're satisfied the 
candidate knows the answers to the questions (or has given up).

Watch out for one-trick ponies. Candidates who only know one particular 
language or programming environment, and protest complete ignorance of 
everything else, are a giant red warning flag.

The point of the phone screen is not for the candidate to drone on about what 
they've done. The interviewer should push them out of their comfort zone a 
bit and ask them related questions about things they haven't seen or done before. 
Ideally, you want to know how this person will react when they face something 
new, such as your codebase.


1) Coding. The candidate has to write some simple code, with correct syntax, 
in C, C++, or Java.

2) OO design. The candidate has to define basic OO concepts, and come up 
with classes to model a simple problem.

3) Scripting and regexes. The candidate has to describe how to find the 
phone numbers in 50,000 HTML pages.

4) Data structures. The candidate has to demonstrate basic knowledge of 
the most common data structures.

5) Bits and bytes. The candidate has to answer simple questions about bits, 
bytes, and binary numbers.


What you're looking for is candidates who are utterly clueless, 
or horribly confused, about the area in question.
t's OK if they need some minor hints or prompting. 
I don't mind if they're rusty or slow

Good candidates for the coding problem are verifiably simple, 
with basic loops or recursion and perhaps a little formatted output 
or file I/O. All we want to know is whether they really do know how 
to program or not.


Scripting and Regular Expressions

Last year my team had to remove all the phone numbers from 50,000 Amazon web 
page templates, since many of the numbers were no longer in service, and we 
also wanted to route all customer contacts through a single page.
Let's say you're on my team, and we have to identify the pages having 
probable U.S. phone numbers in them. To simplify the problem slightly, 
assume we have 50,000 HTML files in a Unix directory tree, under a 
directory called "/website". We have 2 days to get a list of file paths 
to the editorial staff. You need to give me a list of the .html files 
in this directory tree that appear to contain phone numbers in the 
following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx and xxx-xxx-xxxx.

How would you solve this problem? Keep in mind our team is on a short 
(2-day) timeline.

This is an interesting one. Steve says 25% to 35% of all software development 
engineer candidates cannot solve this problem at all-- even with lots of hints 
and given the entire interview hour. What we're looking for is a general 
reluctance to reinvent the wheel, and some familiarity with scripting 
languages and regular expressions. To me, this question indicates whether 
a developer will spend days doing programming work that he or she could 
have neatly avoided with, perhaps, a quick web search and some existing 
code that's already out there.


Data Structures

What are some really common data structures, e.g. in java.util?
When would you use a linked list vs. a vector?
Can you implement a Map with a tree? What about with a list?
How do you print out the nodes of a tree in level-order (i.e. first level, then 2nd level, then 3rd level, etc.)
What's the worst-case insertion performance of a hashtable? Of a binary tree?
What are some options for implementing a priority queue?

lots of companies seems at least equally as interested in knowledge of 
products (if not more interested), such as SQL Server, ASP, and .NET, 
than in fundamental concepts like data structures and big-O algorithmic complexity.

The fact is, it’s easy to get good at interviews after a couple of times. 
You hear the same questions every time, so you can go away and cover the 
holes in your knowledge.

A competent programmer should be able to be programming constructively 
in most other mainstream languages within a few days.

//////The Tech Interview
will be asked very specifically about the work you’ve done, 
but also to solve logic problems or code live or whiteboard some new features.

In fact, one point of the interview is often to push you to your limit 
just to see how you react to not knowing something. If you do an exercise 
too easily, they’ll go to a much harder one. Especially as a beginner, 
you will hit a lot of stumbling points. The biggest asset you have is 
honesty and intellectual curiosity.

When solving a problem, make sure to do so in a clear and logical way, 
explaining out loud why you’re doing each step. Talk through your roadblocks 
and give examples of how you’d find the solution in the “real world”. Often, 
that answer would be to Google for some particular function. Say so! 
They know you’re not a Ruby expert, but they need to know that you’ll 
be able to seek out solutions to the problems you’ll inevitably 
encounter on the job.


It’s also totally okay to use a brute force (inefficient) solution to a 
coding problem. That’s often the best place to start, just so you can 
be sure you’ve got the right feel for the problem.

You’ll usually be asked how you can make the solution better, 
but that’s much better than trying for a brilliant solution and running 
out of time with no work to show for it. Again, your job isn’t to be 
brilliant as much as to be adaptable and thoughtful in the face of challenges.

And if you don’t know something, it’s better to say so and work with your 
interviewer to figure it out. Trust me, they want you to succeed as much as 
you do because there’s nothing tougher as an interviewer than seeing someone 
silently crashing on a problem and getting more and more frustrated but not 
asking for help or providing any window into their thoughts.


data structures and algorithms, just because they’re favorite targets of 
interviewers. They may not be great indicators of coding skill, but the world 
is stuck in its ways and you’ll be asked those more “Computer Science-y” questions.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Chitchat like a pro.


Before diving into code, most interviewers like to chitchat about your 
background. They're looking for:

Metacognition about coding. Do you think about how to code well?

Ownership/leadership. Do you see your work through to completion? 
Do you fix things that aren't quite right, even if you don't have to?

Communication. Would chatting with you about a technical problem be 
useful or painful?


You should have at least one:

example of an interesting technical problem you solved
example of an interpersonal conflict you overcame
example of leadership or ownership
story about what you should have done differently in a past project
piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don't like about said language
question about the company's product/business
question about the company's engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)

Nerd out about stuff. Show you're proud of what you've done, 
you're amped about what they're doing, and you have opinions about 
languages and workflows.


//////Communicate.
A candidate who needed some help along the way but communicated clearly 
can be even better than a candidate who breezed through the question.

Understand what kind of problem it is. There are two types of problems:

Coding. The interviewer wants to see you write clean, efficient code for a problem.
Chitchat. The interviewer just wants you to talk about something. These questions are 
often either (1) high-level system design ("How would you build a Twitter clone?") 
or (2) trivia ("What is hoisting in Javascript?"). Sometimes the trivia is a lead-in 
for a "real" question e.g., "How quickly can we sort a list of integers? 
Good, now suppose instead of integers we had . . ."

If you start writing code and the interviewer just wanted a quick chitchat 
answer before moving on to the "real" question, they'll get frustrated. 
Just ask, "Should we write code for this?"

Make it feel like you're on a team. The interviewer wants to know what it 
feels like to work through a problem with you, so make the interview feel 
collaborative. Use "we" instead of "I," as in, "If we did a breadth-first 
search we'd get an answer in 
�(�)O(n) time." If you get to choose between coding on paper and 
coding on a whiteboard, always choose the whiteboard. That way you'll 
be situated next to the interviewer, facing the problem 
(rather than across from her at a table).

Think out loud. Seriously. Say, "Let's try doing it this way—not sure yet 
if it'll work." If you're stuck, just say what you're thinking. 
Say what might work. Say what you thought could work and why it doesn't work. 
This also goes for trivial chitchat questions. When asked to explain Javascript 
closures, "It's something to do with scope and putting stuff in a function" 
will probably get you 90% credit.

Say you don't know. If you're touching on a fact (e.g., language-specific trivia, 
a hairy bit of runtime analysis), don't try to appear to know something you don't. 
Instead, say "I'm not sure, but I'd guess $thing, because...". 
The because can involve ruling out other options by showing they have 
nonsensical implications, or pulling examples from other languages or 
other problems.

Slow the eff down. Don't confidently blurt out an answer right away. 
If it's right you'll still have to explain it, and if it's wrong you'll 
seem reckless. You don't win anything for speed and you're more likely 
to annoy your interviewer by cutting her off or appearing to jump to conclusions.

//////Get unstuck
Sometimes you'll get stuck. Relax. It doesn't mean you've failed. 
Keep in mind that the interviewer usually cares more about your ability 
to cleverly poke the problem from a few different angles than your ability 
to stumble into the correct answer. When hope seems lost, keep poking.


Draw pictures. Don't waste time trying to think in your head—think on the board. 
Draw a couple different test inputs. Draw how you would get the desired output 
by hand. Then think about translating your approach into code.

Solve a simpler version of the problem. Not sure how to find the 4th 
largest item in the set? Think about how to find the 1st largest item 
and see if you can adapt that approach.

Write a naive, inefficient solution and optimize it later. 
Use brute force. Do whatever it takes to get some kind of answer.


Think out loud more. Say what you know. Say what you thought might 
work and why it won't work. You might realize it actually does work, 
or a modified version does. Or you might get a hint.

Wait for a hint. Don't stare at your interviewer expectantly, 
but do take a brief second to "think"—your interviewer might have already 
decided to give you a hint and is just waiting to avoid interrupting.

Think about the bounds on space and runtime. If you're not sure if 
you can optimize your solution, think about it out loud. For example:

I have to at least look at all of the items, so I can't do better than  O(n)
The brute force approach is to test all possibilities, which is O(n^2)
The answer will contain n^2 items, so I must at least spend that amount of time

Apply a common algorithmic pattern. There are a few patterns 
that come up again and again in the answers to these questions. 
Once you know the patterns, designing an algorithm is just a matter 
of trying a few of them and seeing which one sticks.

Get the Game Plan
Do some research online to find typical technical questions that might be asked. Whiteboard those at home, and make sure your process flows, 
so you won’t get rattled during the real thing.

be more thought-provoking because they want to see soft skills, to find out 
how you solve problems and communicate.” To that end, he suggests you prepare 
by practicing your responses; the more you practice, the more polished and 
tight your eventual presentation. He suggested speaking out loud and having 
someone else listen; while doing that, keep in mind that clarity and accuracy 
are also critical in a tech interview. “Ask whoever is listening, 
if you were clear,” Reed said. “Ask if there were there things you said 
that could have been expanded on, or things you shouldn’t have said at all.”

Be Authentic
Take Notes

the candidate needs to recognize each person in the room. 
“Write down their name and their title as they’re doing introductions,” 
he encouraged. “Make sure you understand why they’re there. Is it the 
technical advisor or a supervisor you’d be responding to? If you understand 
those dynamics, you’ll understand where that person is coming from when they 
ask you questions.”

The hiring manager needs to be absolutely sure that you really and 
truly want this job.

“If you have thoroughly researched the employer, know what the company 
is all about and who does what there,”
“it demonstrates a high level of interest.”

candidates with a little less experience take that same job because 
they were more prepared, which translated into being more excited about 
the position.

//Show and Tell
You need to be able to talk about projects you’ve worked on,

if you have the ability to provide examples and have samples on hand 
from sites like GitHub or Google Code, that’s really powerful.

candidate can and should ask if the interviewer has any concerns or 
obstacles about them getting the position: “This simple question can draw 
out question marks or impressions that can be addressed on the spot before the door closes

How You Can Stand Out in Your Next Web Developer Interview


Passion for what you do without saying “I’m passionate about what I do.” 
It comes in a lot of forms: everything from what projects people do in their 
free time, to getting excited about finding a new or better way to solve a 
problem they’ve been working on in the back of their heads.

Experience is necessary for more senior positions, 
but I’d take an enthusiastic junior over an “Eh, I do this because it’s my job” 
engineer any day of the week.

if they don’t know something off the top of their heads, are willing, able, 
and excited to learn about it. Web tech moves quickly, so being flexible and — 
perhaps more importantly — interested in changing tech is a big thing that 
makes you stand out

Enthusiasm is #1. Passion for learning/personal growth accompanied by 
recent demonstrations of executing on it is #2

When interviews candidates, he’s wants to find out if you 
“live and breathe web dev.”

1. passion for the tech
What kind of blogs or websites do you read? Name some 
influential people you follow on Twitter on LinkedIn.

2. Side-projects. I want you to live and breath web dev.

3.What are you most excited about coming down the pipeline in the next 
few years (or even that have changed over the past few years). Once again, 
that’s a passion indicator. Recently, if you don’t mention Web Components, 
device access (accelerometer, camera, GPS, etc) or all the COOL STUFF we 
can now do in a web app that we couldn’t do a year ago

Beyond that, the rest of the questions are usually geared towards:
1. Specific items on your resume
2. Culture fit
3. Critical thinking
4. Demonstration of technical skills

There are other times when enthusiasm has made up for a lower skill level.


so follow your passions and build side projects that you’re proud to show off. 
Stay up-to-date and let your enthusiasm for web development help you stand out!

Finding a Job You’ll Love: The Interview


The fact that you’ve understood some basic things about their product, 
and that you want to understand more, will set you apart. Of course, 
it will also help you understand what you’d be doing if you worked there.

They don’t really care that you’ve always wanted to learn Lisp and this job 
would let you do so. They care that you can design & implement software, 
quickly understand complexity, etc. With that in mind, ask yourself “what 
are they really trying to get at with this question?” For example, 
if they ask about a particular job on your resume, feel free to say 
that another job is probably more relevant and ask them if they’d rather 
hear about that.

After the initial small talk, ask “What does someone need to be really 
successful at this position?

For the rest of the hour, when answering questions, try to answer with 
stuff related to what they’re looking for. Also, write down the answer. 
You’ll want to refer to it much later when you’re trying to decide between 
the different places you interviewed at.

here are some good questions to ask:
What are the day-to-day tasks I’d have? 
What day-to-day tasks do you typically do? What have you been doing over the past month?

For the tech lead:
How is scheduling done? How are estimates and deadlines created?
How are tasks divided up among programmers?
Who does the overall design/architecture?
Who does the design/architecture of individual contributor’s tasks?
How much time do leads spend with their programmers?
Do you do code reviews? How are they done?
How much do you look over people’s check ins?

40 Key Computer Science Concepts Explained In Layman’s Terms


//////Core Concept #1 – Algorithms and Data Structures
////1.1 – Big O Notation
number of purchased item (input) doesn’t affect the delivery time. 
The output is constant. We call this O(1).

For online downloading, the download time is directly proportional 
to the movie file sizes (input). We call this O(n).


////1.2 Sorting Algorithms

////1.3 Recursion
A nurse is carrying a tray with a box of cocoa and a cup containing a 
smaller image of her holding the same thing, which in turn contains 
an even smaller version of the image, and so on.

////1.4 – Big Data
Big data describes data sets so large and complex that is impossible 
to manage with conventional data processing tools.

////1.5 – Data Structures
Every computer scientist and programmer should at least know:

Array,Tree,Stack,Queue,Graph,Hash Table,Linked List,Heap


//////Core Concept #2 – Artificial Intelligence

////2.1 – Greedy Algorithm
Just take paths that slope upwards the most.
A greedy algorithm picks the best immediate choice and never reconsiders its choices.


////2.2 Hill Climbing
The hill climbing algorithm attempts to find a better solution by generating 
a neighboring solution. Each neighboring solution is generated based on 
the best solution so far, with a single element modified.


////2.3 Simulated Annealing
Instead of always climbing upwards, you occasionally move to a lower point 
and explore other paths, to reducing your chance of taking the wrong path. 
The higher you climb, the lower the probability you move to a lower point 
and explore.


////2.4 – Dynamic Programming
So you didn’t need to recount because you remembered it 
was eight before. Brilliant!
The example above describes memoization (yes memoization not memorization), 
a top-down approach in dynamic programming, which store the results of 
previous computations for future use.

////2.5 – Machine Learning


////2.6 – P vs NP Problem
Q1: 7 x 17 = p
Q2: p x q = 119 (p & q cannot be 1 & 119)
what p and q are ?

you probably have to go through all possible numbers from 2 to 118. 
We are yet to discover an efficient algorithm that can find the factors 
of a number easily.

What if I ask you: Could p possibly be 7? You can easily verify 
the answer right? Just divide 119 by 7!

Q2 is a NP (nondeterministic polynomial) problem because it is easy to verify, 
but hard to solve
Finding the factors of 119 is still fairly easy for computer to solve, 
but how about a 500-digit number? It’s impossible for any computers right now.


//////Core Concept #3 – Computer Architecture and Engineering
////3.1 – How do computers work?

////3.2 – Halting Problem


//////Core Concept #4 – Concurrency
Every time the phone rings, you have to stop whatever task you are working on.
which you are working based on priority

////4.1 – Parallelism
Parallelism allows 2 or more tasks to run at the same time, 
provided that the machine has multiprocessing capability.

However, the implementation of concurrency concepts also introduces more 
potential problems such as race condition.


////4.2 – Race Condition
imagine two transactions happening in a bank account in the same time
one takes and one gives
both will see the original number
and the latter action will put its result based on the original number
without taking into account the before action

So, what can you do to handle the above situation? One really simple way 
is mutual exclusion.

////4.3 – Mutual Exclusion (Mutex)
Now, whenever there’s an ongoing transaction, the system will lock the account(s) 
involved in the transaction.

This time, the moment when transaction A occurs, your account is locked. 
You can’t withdraw money from ATM. It unlocks only when transaction A completes.

So mutual exclusion solves the problem right? Yes, but nobody wants to get 
rejected by the ATM every time there’s an ongoing transaction.

let's modify the solution a little bit

////4.4 – Semaphore
//4.4.1 – Binary Semaphore
When you withdraw money from ATM, transaction A (the bank transfer) 
will stop and allow transaction B to carry on first because it has higher 
priority. It will resume after transaction B is completed.

//4.4.2 – Counting Semaphore
ockers are full, others have to queue up. Whenever someone is done, 
he/she will hand over the key to the first person in the queue.


////4.5 – Deadlock
access to a bank account is locked whenever there’s an ongoing transaction.

Peter transfer $1000 to you (transaction A) and you transfer $500 to him at the same time (transaction B).
Transaction A locks Peter’s account and deducts $1000 from Peter’s account.
Transaction B locks your account and deducts $500 from your account.
Then, transaction A tries access your account to add the $1000 from Peter.
At the same time, transaction B also tries to add your $500 to Peter’s account.

since both transactions aren’t completed, both can’t access the locked accounts. 
Both wait for each other to complete. Deadlock.


//////Core Concept #5 – Computer Security
////5.1 – Computer Hacking

//5.1.1 – Brute-force Attack
Try hundreds and thousands of different keys. An experienced burglar 
will try the most commonly used keys first.

A brute-force attack tries every possible passwords, and usually starts 
by guessing commonly used passwords like “123456”, “abcdef”, etc.

//5.1.2 – Social Engineering
Social engineering is tricking users into revealing their private information.


//5.1.3 – Security Exploit
A burglar checks every possible entries to find the easiest way (weakness) 
to get in. Maybe your second-floor windows is left open, who knows?

//5.1.4 – Trojan Horse
A trojan horse is malware program that pretends to be useful or helpful 
and runs malicious code in the background.

//5.1.5 – Rootkit
Your door lock is jammed and you call a locksmith. He fixes your door lock 
and secretly duplicates another key.

A rootkit gains administrator or root access of a computer through 
various ways like social engineering, then disguise as necessary files 
that is hard to detect by antivirus software.

//5.1.6 – Distributed Denial-of-service Attack (DDoS)
DDoS attempts to bring a site or service down by flooding it with visitors.

//5.2 – Cryptography
the study and application of secure communication.

//5.2.1 – Symmetric cryptography
make 2 identical (symmetric) keys for the lock and meet up to share 
the keys beforehand.

//5.2.2 – Asymmetric cryptography
Anyone can close the padlocks public (encrypt), but only she has the key to 
open private (decrypt) them.
so not have different keys for everyone


//////Core Concept #6 – Software Development Methodologies
////6.1 – Waterfall Development

////6.2 – Agile Development
You figure out some of the things you need to do at the beginning. 
Then, continuously improve, evolve, collaborate and adapt as the development 
goes on.

////6.3 – Software Development In The Real World
cowboy coding

Computer scientist is like a physicist and programmer is like an engineer.

programming is Writing very specific instructions to a dumb, yet obedient machine.

That’s how computer works. You have to tell the computer what it exactly 
needs to do. It doesn’t know how to assume and never think about the consequences.

Q3 – Why you shouldn’t interrupt a developer when he/she is in the zone?
Getting into the zone is like falling asleep. Imagine you are waking up a 
person who is close to falling asleep in few more seconds. 
Now he/she has to spend more time to fall back into sleep!

Java and Javascript are similar like car and carpet are similar.

Javascript is the ugly nerd and jQuery is the wizard who turns 
him into the handsome quarterback.

Q6 – What is the difference between a framework and library?
A library is a tool. A framework is a way of life.

Measuring software productivity by lines of code is like measuring 
progress on an airplane by how much it weighs.

Q8 – What is object-oriented programming?
You have no idea how I did that. You have no knowledge of the laundry place. 
Maybe you speak French, and you can’t even hail a taxi. You can’t pay for one, 
you don’t have dollars in your pocket. Yet I knew how to do all of that. 
And you didn’t have to know any of it. All that complexity was hidden 
inside of me, and we were able to interact at a very high level of abstraction.
about you having a laundry to do and i make it happen
That’s what objects are. They encapsulate complexity, and the interfaces to 
that complexity are high level.

Q9 – What is an application program interface (API)?
At restaurants, you order food (call API) from the menu (APIs). 
Once your food is ready (API response is ready), 
the waiter will serve you the food.

The basic idea is: you ask for what you want and the system returns 
you a response, without exposing what’s happening behind the scene.

Q10 – What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL database?
NoSQL databases store information like you would recipes in a book. 
When you want to know how to make a cake, you go to that recipe, and all 
of the information about how to make that cake (ingredients, preparation, 
mixing, baking, finishing, etc.) are all on that one page.

SQL is like shopping for the ingredients for the recipe. In order to get 
all of your ingredients into your cart, you have to go to many different 
aisles to get each ingredient. When you are done shopping, your grocery 
cart will be full of all the ingredients you had to run around and collect.

Wouldn’t it be nicer if there was a store was organized by recipe, so you 
could go to one place in the store and grab everything you need from that 
one spot? Granted you’ll find ingredients like eggs in 50 different places, 
so there’s a bit of overhead when stocking the shelves, but from a consumer 
standpoint it was much easier/faster to find what they were looking for.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////The tech challenge
The take-home tech challenge may occur before or after the in-person screen, 
depending on the company. They will give you an application or problem which 
will take up to a full day to complete on your own time. 
Examples of take-home tech challenges include building out a 
sample web app with tests or solving a challenging algorithmic problem using code.

completeness and quality of code
it’s a good mechanism for them to test your commitment (up to half of people never even turn in a solution).

////The Final Step: “Fit”
The final step before the final decision is usually to meet the whole team 
and get put through the paces at their offices over the period of several hours. 
They’ll probably test you technically but the goal is also to make sure you’d 
be a good person to work with. If any one member of the team doesn’t think 
you’d be a good fit, you usually won’t be hired. Advice? Don’t be weird 
or awkward even if you are at home :)

It’s also a chance for you to test them out. If you’ve gotten this far in 
the process, there’s a reasonable likelihood that you’ve got a good match. 
You’ll need to figure out if this is the kind of company you want to work 
for so bring a list of questions and make sure they get answered.


////A Note on Compensation
Be mindful when providing your salary expectations. 
Companies will always ask you “how much do you expect to get paid”, 
often in the initial phone screen. Providing a single concrete number 
can be the opposite of beneficial, because you may offer a number higher 
than their range and thus be deemed too expensive, or you may have come 
in too low and they now know they may be able to cap your offered 
compensation at a lower number than they might have. 
It’s safest to provide a range (e.g. “I am looking for 
something between $80,000 - $90,000.”) in order to better meet their 
budget and also allow some wiggle room for negotiations.

Once you have an offer, you can check it against fair market rate 
by asking other people (hopefully you’ve got some people by now who you might ask) 
or going to the below resources to compare. While “junior” doesn’t equate to 
being underpaid, do be mindful to adjust for years of experience 
(0-1) as to get the most accurate picture.

Glassdoor, https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm
Comparably
Payscale
Talent https://www.talent.com/salary

Finally, if a recruiter has reached out to you, it can also be helpful 
to ask what the budget for the role is up front. However, this must be 
done tactfully. If you have not been asked your compensation expectations 
and have not been told the budget up front in the initial message, 
it can be a great way to understand if both parties are wasting each other’s time, 
but do keep in mind that asking must be done in a respectful manner. 
It can be helpful to phrase this ask by saying, 
“Is there an allocated salary range for the role?”. 
Sometimes they may reply that the salary is based on experience, 
so do keep in mind your range as you move through the interview process!
