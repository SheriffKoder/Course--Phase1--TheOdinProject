*ability to put together a content-managed website.
*proof that I could actually deliver on a CMS soon after the interview.

*CRUD application with PHP/MySQL


I taught myself about [HTTP][http-rfc], managing complexity and version control. 
I invested in touch-typing, learned how to use vim to an intermediate level 
and received a harsh introduction to the world of web application security.

extend yourself


received an offer for a permanent full-time role for a salary of £21,000 per annum 
(roughly $34,000 USD). At the time I knew this wasn't a great salary.
that is 87E$

next job
salary stayed in the £20k-£30k ($34k-$48k) range. work and doing freelance work

next job after a year and a half
two offers in hand. Both were at £38k ($61k)

recruiter had submitted me for a position as a "senior" developer. 
At this stage I had roughly two years of experience developing web professionally, 
and would never have had the confidence to apply as a senior developer on my own.


////Senior interview:
grilled on every skill listed on my CV. In each instance I was questioned 
until I had to say "I don't know, but I'd search the documentation/rfc/google 
for x to find out".

I was given mock scenarios for high-scalability web applications, asked 
to "explain polymorphism without reference to animals or shapes

and had to talk through a code review with developers from the team, 
spotting badly chosen algorithms, subtle errors and bad coding style with as 
much politeness as I could muster.
topics like composition over inheritance

I was invited back for a second interview in a few days where 
I was to give a presentation on a technical topic of my choosing 
(out of a list of possible options). I went with hash tables as 
I remembered a thing or two about them from university and could piece 
together the rest from wikipedia.


I made it clear that the presentation would very much be a condensed version 
of the wikipedia article before starting, and then spoke for around ten minutes 
on the topic. After the presentation I was again grilled, this time on favorable 
properties of hashing functions, common problems, possible solutions etc. 
I had done my research and was prepared for the initial barrage, 
but it wasn't long before my knowledge on the subject ran dry.


I again went home, this time quite sure that I wouldn't get the offer from Bravo. 
I didn't have enough experience to be a "senior" developer and I felt my knowledge 
bottomed out in the interview far too often.

Around a week later, the recruiter got back to me to let me know that Bravo 
wanted to bring me on as a senior developer for £44,000 per annum ($70k), 
more than double the salary I started on as a web developer only two years ago.
180k/m, 2.1m/y

It was such a huge jump for me that I felt like there was some catch, 
some downside that I had missed because I didn't quite deserve this level of 
compensation just yet.

I accepted the offer. Working at Bravo was by far the hardest and most educational 
technical job I've yet to experience. Among other things, we had:


A polyglot codebase (PHP/ActionScript for the web front-end, Java for back-end services)


My job had been to have my assumptions questioned, hard, by people who 
were a lot smarter than me.
After that, not only was I capable of having strong technical opinions, 
I was able to articulate them clearly.
while working started to feel a lot more confident in my abilities by the end of my time there.


//////Finding your first few web developer jobs
Over the course of my career I've applied to more openings, 
attended more interviews and turned down more offers than I can honestly remember. 

1. Start building assets that make you more hirable
2. Collect information on a large number of job openings to get a feel for the market
3. Prioritize the leads based on a set of criteria, personal to you
4. Apply to the most attractive leads based on your criteria with a CV, and covering letter.
5. Prepare for and give a good interview when invited
6. Only make a decision when you have at least three offers in hand.


just make sure you are accepting what you would mostly get at this point
not take it on faith from someone who benefits from you accepting a lower salary.


//////1. Build Advantages

Before you start the application process, 
you need to have a number of advantages


1) Social Proof. 
If you've been hired by three other companies in the past, 
have a string of testimonials and the battle scars to show for them, 
you become a lot easier to hire.

Building a network of professionals that can vouch for you not only 
makes you more valuable in the eyes of potential hirers, it also gives 
you a lot of confidence going into an interview.

Actionable advice: Get hired as a web developer and spend a few years 
doing a good job of it. Failing that, attend local user groups and 
tech-scene events, meet people in real life and try to impart something 
of value when you do.




2) Technical Depth. 
I believe that anyone who works programming computers should 
"know what they don't know" about the entire stack

Actionable advice: Read about the job of programming and take steps 
to get better at it. Learn about OS fundamentals, object oriented design patterns, 
functional programming, network protocols, 
finite state automata, data structures + algorithms and whatever 
the hell else you can get your hands on.



3)Technical Skill
it does not matter what tool you use 
as long as you know those tools well

Also, learning to use a VCS (e.g. git) is a prerequisite for any programming job 
in the 21st century.

Actionable advice: Use deliberate practice to get better at building software. 
There's a difference between knowing the perfect recipe for a roast chicken and 
having the skill to debone one in sixty seconds. If there's any technical 
skill you can think of that you're worried about not having, chase it down, 
practice it and own it.

Some examples might be getting better at modifying code in your favorite 
text editor, learning how to set up and configure a web server by hand, 
doing non-trivial joins in SQL or improving your abilities at the 
terminal with coreutils.


4) A Web Presence
If I go to your personal homepage, is there an easy way for me to find about 
your expertise? Do you have a profile on LinkedIn that I can read through 
to find out about your experience and skillset? Can I at least get a 
hold of your CV? 
You don't need to be a prolific blogger

Actionable advice: Build a website that shows off you skills, 
experience and portfolio, making sure it links to other places on the 
internet where you can be found. This could be a single page with an intro, 
contact information and sections headed 'skills', 'experience', 'portfolio' 
and 'links'. Don't spend forever on this, just get that single page up, 
make it look half decent and move on.

5)Working Software, publicly available
Hirers just want to confirm that you can code at all. 
Make this easy for them by building things and putting the things you 
built where they can see them.


Actionable advice: Spend a little time brainstorming potential portfolio pieces, 
pick the most interesting project out of your list and build it. The smaller 
and easier to complete, the better. Once you've finished, make it available 
at a public URL and host the code on github. Repeat twice for best results.

None of these advantages are things that you can build overnight. 
They take consistent effort over the course of at least a month. 
Without them, it will be difficult to secure an interview.



//////2. Collect Leads

Using Highrise, a text file or some paper filing system, create a list of leads. 
For each lead list:

Name of the company if known
Contact information for sending an application
A URL to the job listing if applicable

Good sources for leads, in order of preference:
Your personal network
Direct Applications
Job Boards
Recruiters

for leads from your network
nicely worded email to everyone in your circle
informing them of your current situation
the kind of work you're looking for
and link to your personal homepage (where hirers can find out more about you)

To find out what companies are hiring technical staff, it's worth looking for 
places that already list companies that build software. Silicon Milk Roundabout, 
Techcrunch, YC Alumni, client lists of software consultancies or anywhere else 
software companies are listed will do the trick. For each list, 
visit the companies website, look for their 'jobs' section and add any 
potential leads to your list.

Authentic Jobs
Github Jobs
StackOverflow Jobs
Hacker Jobs UK
CWJobs

Try to resist the urge to apply straight away. 
At the moment the goal is to collect a large swathe of leads to get a 
feel for the technical employment market right now.


treat recruiters like any other lead, log the job spec and continue. 
Before working with recruiters on a real-life opening, 
I would strongly recommend reading Secrets of Power Negotiating by Roger Dawson. 
It lists in detail exactly the sort of tactics that recruiters will use 
when dealing with you. Best to go into any business with recruiters 
with your eyes wide open.






//////3. Qualify Leads: 
Make a list of criteria for prioritizing opportunities

When looking at a job prospect, different 
things are important to different people.

list of questions that I ask myself about a given lead to qualify it:

A) Are you likely to secure an offer? are you fit for the role?

B) Will your skills and knowledge progress (in the direction you want them to)?
If you want to level up as a developer, you won't be challenged if you're 
building content managed websites forever. Based on what the company does 
and the sort of technical tasks it will entail, will you have passion for the work?

C) Will the job pay you enough?
any job you apply to needs to pay you enough so that money isn't an issue for you.

D)Is the job secure enough?
 Do you want to be the first hire in an early stage startup? A new member of an established technical team?

E) Am I going to be productive with this company? 
Will they have some sort  of iterative development process or is 
it the same chaos that most companies that happen to need programmers 
find themselves in?


Add or remove questions as you see fit. Remote work may be an important factor 
for you if you don't live near a major city. You might prefer to work with 
many clients in a consultancy, or work on an in-house development team 
responsible for both new features and maintenance. You might have a 
preference for front-end over back-end work.

Based on your collection of leads you should have a good idea of the sort 
of jobs available to you in the current market, so you can adjust your 
criteria accordingly.

Your list doesn't need to be a iron-clad; we're just trying to figure out 
what's important to you in any potential job opening. When looking for a 
job it can be quite tempting to accept whatever offer comes your way. 
Knowing what's important to you before you even make an application 
should help you keep focused on your own priorities rather than 
those of the companies trying to hire you.

Once you have a good idea of what's important to you, take your shortlist 
of leads and remove any that have no chance of meeting your criteria.

You don't want to rule out too many leads, just the ones that are obviously 
not a good fit for you.

It can be difficult to assess suitability without having an in-person meeting, 
so be liberal in what you let through for now.



//////4. Make Applications

For each of your leads that have made it through your qualification stage, 
you're going to apply with a CV and a short email.

To begin, you'll need to put a CV together that highlights all the 
advantages you've built up. To reiterate, those include technical depth, 
technical skill, social proof and working software.

For social proof you might list some of the companies you've worked for 
and/or testimonials you've received from past colleagues. This could be 
for jobs that are non-technical if you have no relevant full-time experience.

For technical depth/skill you could highlight some of the technologies you've 
worked with and can reason about at different levels of abstraction. 
You'll should be able to talk confidently about anything you list here, 
and and demonstrate relevant skill in an interview.

For working software you should link to either a working installation of 
an application that you created or a code sample that you were responsible 
for. Make this easy to find and preview.

2-5 examples of each of the above will go a long way towards making your 
case to hirers selecting candidates for interview.

While the core content and stories of your CV should remain the same, 
it's worth customizing it to specific job descriptions. 
If you're applying for a job that will entail statistics 
and machine learning, you might choose a different set of sample projects 
than you would if you were applying for job building e-commerce websites.



You'll also need to write a brief covering email along with your CV, 
highlighting your suitability for the role.


If you're missing a major requirement listed in the job spec, ignoring 
it is the worst thing you can do. Your best shot at making up for any 
shortcomings is to address them directly and highlight your will and 
ability to learn fast and not be a burden on your future team. 
The covering letter is a good a place as any to do this.


an example below of the sort of covering letter 
I might send over as a fresh-faced newbie

/////////////
Hi Alice,

I'm Bob, a web developer currently available for full-time employment.

According to your company website, you're currently hiring web developers. Based on the information outlined there, I believe I would make a good addition to your team.

You might notice that I don't have any commercial experience, so I would be applying to this role as a junior developer. While I've never worked as a full-time web developer before, I'm proficient with many of the technologies listed in your requirements, have deployed working software and believe I would contribute value to your development team from day one.

Please find attached my CV with links to code samples and projects that demonstrate my abilities. Additionally, you can see my profile on github here: http://github.com/example-example-example

It would be great to meet for a chat at some point if you have any interest in taking this further.

Kind Regards,

-Bob, http://bobthewebdeveloper.example.com/
/////////////


Don't just copy this blindly and hope. Mention reasons why 
you're a good fit for the role/company
if you're not and you don't, then you should be and you should.


For each application, log the date that you applied in your lead filing system 
and be sure to follow up via email a set number of days later. 
My follow up schedule (assuming no response) is three days, 
one further week and an additional two further weeks before giving up on a lead. 
There are a million reasons why a potential hirer may forget to get back to you, 
so make it easy for them to remember. Follow up.


Take care with each application and make only three or four at a time. 
Applying to every one of your leads at the same time can be confusing 
for you and won't help you to make as good an impression as possible on each hirer. 
Wait a week before applying to more, and feel free to update your leads list 
based on new opportunities or information.

If they come back with a rejection, use it as an opportunity to learn. 
Being as courteous as humanly possible, ask them what their concerns were 
about your profile. For future applications, modify your covering letter 
copy to address any issues that they raise.






//////5. Interview Well
If your applications go well, with a bit of luck you should 
be invited to interview at least once.

If you've made it this far
you're most of the way to securing an offer. 

If they weren't interested in hiring you, 
they wouldn't invite you in for interview.

There are as many types of interview as there are companies that hire programmers. 

There are highly technical slogging matches, going through 
data structures and ERDs on whiteboards. 

There are entirely non-technical interviews that speak in very 
broad terms about your history and abilities.

They can be one-on-one, two-on-one or with a panel. 

You might have pre-interview programming challenges or multiple phone 
screens before you're even called in to interview.

With all this variation, it can be difficult to plan a general strategy 
for success at interview for a programming job.


Most interviewers are worse at interviewing than you are at attending interviews.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make yourself monstrously hireable in spite of all of the above.


Interviews for programming work typically contain the following 
elements in some order:

Non-technical questions for you
Questions you have for them
Technical challenges for you to complete

to help you find out how well the company does against your own personal criteria.

////Questions for you
The non-technical part of the interview is where you have opportunity 
after opportunity to demonstrate the value you would bring to a given 
organization. Your job is to seek out these opportunities and exploit them, 
for both your benefit and the interviewers.

No one hiring developers wakes up in the morning and says to themselves 
"I don't want to meet a technically competent candidate who can communicate 
as well as he can write code today."

Do a quick exercise: in your notebook write a list of the questions you 
think interviewers might ask you. What would you ask if you were hiring 
you and were given your CV? I'll do the exercise for myself right 
here as an example, but your questions will be different:

Tell me about your work history.
What experience do you have with Ruby on Rails?
It says here you can speak fluent Japanese, you're kidding, right?
What was your experience at #{past company} like?
What's a technically challenging thing you've worked on recently?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Where do you see yourself in five years time?
Are you more of a front end or back end developer?
What sort of role do you play on a development team?


For each of the questions you come up with, have an answer prepared. 
You can write out your answers in detail if you prefer
you can have a note book of the answer point to catch on in the interview

The goal is not to recite prepared answers to all possible questions, 
but simply to get in the mindset of talking confidently about your experience 
and skills.

Have stories to tell about your experiences so far, the technology 
you've used and the software you've built. Try to weave together a 
narrative about your work experience that the interviewer can follow easily.

There may be questions you haven't prepared for, 
but after thinking through answers for a good sample, 
you should be able to tackle most non-technical questions with confidence.

Where possible, you want to highlight skills and experience that are 
directly relevant to the work you would be doing at the interviewers company.

Questions for them
