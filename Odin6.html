*ability to put together a content-managed website.
*proof that I could actually deliver on a CMS soon after the interview.

*CRUD application with PHP/MySQL


I taught myself about [HTTP][http-rfc], managing complexity and version control. 
I invested in touch-typing, learned how to use vim to an intermediate level 
and received a harsh introduction to the world of web application security.

extend yourself


received an offer for a permanent full-time role for a salary of £21,000 per annum 
(roughly $34,000 USD). At the time I knew this wasn't a great salary.
that is 87E$

next job
salary stayed in the £20k-£30k ($34k-$48k) range. work and doing freelance work

next job after a year and a half
two offers in hand. Both were at £38k ($61k)

recruiter had submitted me for a position as a "senior" developer. 
At this stage I had roughly two years of experience developing web professionally, 
and would never have had the confidence to apply as a senior developer on my own.


////Senior interview:
grilled on every skill listed on my CV. In each instance I was questioned 
until I had to say "I don't know, but I'd search the documentation/rfc/google 
for x to find out".

I was given mock scenarios for high-scalability web applications, asked 
to "explain polymorphism without reference to animals or shapes

and had to talk through a code review with developers from the team, 
spotting badly chosen algorithms, subtle errors and bad coding style with as 
much politeness as I could muster.
topics like composition over inheritance

I was invited back for a second interview in a few days where 
I was to give a presentation on a technical topic of my choosing 
(out of a list of possible options). I went with hash tables as 
I remembered a thing or two about them from university and could piece 
together the rest from wikipedia.


I made it clear that the presentation would very much be a condensed version 
of the wikipedia article before starting, and then spoke for around ten minutes 
on the topic. After the presentation I was again grilled, this time on favorable 
properties of hashing functions, common problems, possible solutions etc. 
I had done my research and was prepared for the initial barrage, 
but it wasn't long before my knowledge on the subject ran dry.


I again went home, this time quite sure that I wouldn't get the offer from Bravo. 
I didn't have enough experience to be a "senior" developer and I felt my knowledge 
bottomed out in the interview far too often.

Around a week later, the recruiter got back to me to let me know that Bravo 
wanted to bring me on as a senior developer for £44,000 per annum ($70k), 
more than double the salary I started on as a web developer only two years ago.
180k/m, 2.1m/y

It was such a huge jump for me that I felt like there was some catch, 
some downside that I had missed because I didn't quite deserve this level of 
compensation just yet.

I accepted the offer. Working at Bravo was by far the hardest and most educational 
technical job I've yet to experience. Among other things, we had:


A polyglot codebase (PHP/ActionScript for the web front-end, Java for back-end services)


My job had been to have my assumptions questioned, hard, by people who 
were a lot smarter than me.
After that, not only was I capable of having strong technical opinions, 
I was able to articulate them clearly.
while working started to feel a lot more confident in my abilities by the end of my time there.


//////Finding your first few web developer jobs
Over the course of my career I've applied to more openings, 
attended more interviews and turned down more offers than I can honestly remember. 

1. Start building assets that make you more hirable
2. Collect information on a large number of job openings to get a feel for the market
3. Prioritize the leads based on a set of criteria, personal to you
4. Apply to the most attractive leads based on your criteria with a CV, and covering letter.
5. Prepare for and give a good interview when invited
6. Only make a decision when you have at least three offers in hand.


just make sure you are accepting what you would mostly get at this point
not take it on faith from someone who benefits from you accepting a lower salary.


//////1. Build Advantages

Before you start the application process, 
you need to have a number of advantages


1) Social Proof. 
If you've been hired by three other companies in the past, 
have a string of testimonials and the battle scars to show for them, 
you become a lot easier to hire.

Building a network of professionals that can vouch for you not only 
makes you more valuable in the eyes of potential hirers, it also gives 
you a lot of confidence going into an interview.

Actionable advice: Get hired as a web developer and spend a few years 
doing a good job of it. Failing that, attend local user groups and 
tech-scene events, meet people in real life and try to impart something 
of value when you do.




2) Technical Depth. 
I believe that anyone who works programming computers should 
"know what they don't know" about the entire stack

Actionable advice: Read about the job of programming and take steps 
to get better at it. Learn about OS fundamentals, object oriented design patterns, 
functional programming, network protocols, 
finite state automata, data structures + algorithms and whatever 
the hell else you can get your hands on.



3)Technical Skill
it does not matter what tool you use 
as long as you know those tools well

Also, learning to use a VCS (e.g. git) is a prerequisite for any programming job 
in the 21st century.

Actionable advice: Use deliberate practice to get better at building software. 
There's a difference between knowing the perfect recipe for a roast chicken and 
having the skill to debone one in sixty seconds. If there's any technical 
skill you can think of that you're worried about not having, chase it down, 
practice it and own it.

Some examples might be getting better at modifying code in your favorite 
text editor, learning how to set up and configure a web server by hand, 
doing non-trivial joins in SQL or improving your abilities at the 
terminal with coreutils.


4) A Web Presence
If I go to your personal homepage, is there an easy way for me to find about 
your expertise? Do you have a profile on LinkedIn that I can read through 
to find out about your experience and skillset? Can I at least get a 
hold of your CV? 
You don't need to be a prolific blogger

Actionable advice: Build a website that shows off you skills, 
experience and portfolio, making sure it links to other places on the 
internet where you can be found. This could be a single page with an intro, 
contact information and sections headed 'skills', 'experience', 'portfolio' 
and 'links'. Don't spend forever on this, just get that single page up, 
make it look half decent and move on.

5)Working Software, publicly available
Hirers just want to confirm that you can code at all. 
Make this easy for them by building things and putting the things you 
built where they can see them.


Actionable advice: Spend a little time brainstorming potential portfolio pieces, 
pick the most interesting project out of your list and build it. The smaller 
and easier to complete, the better. Once you've finished, make it available 
at a public URL and host the code on github. Repeat twice for best results.

None of these advantages are things that you can build overnight. 
They take consistent effort over the course of at least a month. 
Without them, it will be difficult to secure an interview.



//////2. Collect Leads

Using Highrise, a text file or some paper filing system, create a list of leads. 
For each lead list:

Name of the company if known
Contact information for sending an application
A URL to the job listing if applicable

Good sources for leads, in order of preference:
Your personal network
Direct Applications
Job Boards
Recruiters

for leads from your network
nicely worded email to everyone in your circle
informing them of your current situation
the kind of work you're looking for
and link to your personal homepage (where hirers can find out more about you)

To find out what companies are hiring technical staff, it's worth looking for 
places that already list companies that build software. Silicon Milk Roundabout, 
Techcrunch, YC Alumni, client lists of software consultancies or anywhere else 
software companies are listed will do the trick. For each list, 
visit the companies website, look for their 'jobs' section and add any 
potential leads to your list.

Authentic Jobs
Github Jobs
StackOverflow Jobs
Hacker Jobs UK
CWJobs

Try to resist the urge to apply straight away. 
At the moment the goal is to collect a large swathe of leads to get a 
feel for the technical employment market right now.


treat recruiters like any other lead, log the job spec and continue. 
Before working with recruiters on a real-life opening, 
I would strongly recommend reading Secrets of Power Negotiating by Roger Dawson. 
It lists in detail exactly the sort of tactics that recruiters will use 
when dealing with you. Best to go into any business with recruiters 
with your eyes wide open.






//////3. Qualify Leads: 
Make a list of criteria for prioritizing opportunities

When looking at a job prospect, different 
things are important to different people.

list of questions that I ask myself about a given lead to qualify it:

A) Are you likely to secure an offer? are you fit for the role?

B) Will your skills and knowledge progress (in the direction you want them to)?
If you want to level up as a developer, you won't be challenged if you're 
building content managed websites forever. Based on what the company does 
and the sort of technical tasks it will entail, will you have passion for the work?

C) Will the job pay you enough?
any job you apply to needs to pay you enough so that money isn't an issue for you.

D)Is the job secure enough?
 Do you want to be the first hire in an early stage startup? A new member of an established technical team?

E) Am I going to be productive with this company? 
Will they have some sort  of iterative development process or is 
it the same chaos that most companies that happen to need programmers 
find themselves in?


Add or remove questions as you see fit. Remote work may be an important factor 
for you if you don't live near a major city. You might prefer to work with 
many clients in a consultancy, or work on an in-house development team 
responsible for both new features and maintenance. You might have a 
preference for front-end over back-end work.

Based on your collection of leads you should have a good idea of the sort 
of jobs available to you in the current market, so you can adjust your 
criteria accordingly.

Your list doesn't need to be a iron-clad; we're just trying to figure out 
what's important to you in any potential job opening. When looking for a 
job it can be quite tempting to accept whatever offer comes your way. 
Knowing what's important to you before you even make an application 
should help you keep focused on your own priorities rather than 
those of the companies trying to hire you.

Once you have a good idea of what's important to you, take your shortlist 
of leads and remove any that have no chance of meeting your criteria.

You don't want to rule out too many leads, just the ones that are obviously 
not a good fit for you.

It can be difficult to assess suitability without having an in-person meeting, 
so be liberal in what you let through for now.



//////4. Make Applications

For each of your leads that have made it through your qualification stage, 
you're going to apply with a CV and a short email.

To begin, you'll need to put a CV together that highlights all the 
advantages you've built up. To reiterate, those include technical depth, 
technical skill, social proof and working software.

For social proof you might list some of the companies you've worked for 
and/or testimonials you've received from past colleagues. This could be 
for jobs that are non-technical if you have no relevant full-time experience.

For technical depth/skill you could highlight some of the technologies you've 
worked with and can reason about at different levels of abstraction. 
You'll should be able to talk confidently about anything you list here, 
and and demonstrate relevant skill in an interview.

For working software you should link to either a working installation of 
an application that you created or a code sample that you were responsible 
for. Make this easy to find and preview.

2-5 examples of each of the above will go a long way towards making your 
case to hirers selecting candidates for interview.

While the core content and stories of your CV should remain the same, 
it's worth customizing it to specific job descriptions. 
If you're applying for a job that will entail statistics 
and machine learning, you might choose a different set of sample projects 
than you would if you were applying for job building e-commerce websites.



You'll also need to write a brief covering email along with your CV, 
highlighting your suitability for the role.


If you're missing a major requirement listed in the job spec, ignoring 
it is the worst thing you can do. Your best shot at making up for any 
shortcomings is to address them directly and highlight your will and 
ability to learn fast and not be a burden on your future team. 
The covering letter is a good a place as any to do this.


an example below of the sort of covering letter 
I might send over as a fresh-faced newbie

/////////////
Hi Alice,

I'm Bob, a web developer currently available for full-time employment.

According to your company website, you're currently hiring web developers. Based on the information outlined there, I believe I would make a good addition to your team.

You might notice that I don't have any commercial experience, so I would be applying to this role as a junior developer. While I've never worked as a full-time web developer before, I'm proficient with many of the technologies listed in your requirements, have deployed working software and believe I would contribute value to your development team from day one.

Please find attached my CV with links to code samples and projects that demonstrate my abilities. Additionally, you can see my profile on github here: http://github.com/example-example-example

It would be great to meet for a chat at some point if you have any interest in taking this further.

Kind Regards,

-Bob, http://bobthewebdeveloper.example.com/
/////////////


Don't just copy this blindly and hope. Mention reasons why 
you're a good fit for the role/company
if you're not and you don't, then you should be and you should.


For each application, log the date that you applied in your lead filing system 
and be sure to follow up via email a set number of days later. 
My follow up schedule (assuming no response) is three days, 
one further week and an additional two further weeks before giving up on a lead. 
There are a million reasons why a potential hirer may forget to get back to you, 
so make it easy for them to remember. Follow up.


Take care with each application and make only three or four at a time. 
Applying to every one of your leads at the same time can be confusing 
for you and won't help you to make as good an impression as possible on each hirer. 
Wait a week before applying to more, and feel free to update your leads list 
based on new opportunities or information.

If they come back with a rejection, use it as an opportunity to learn. 
Being as courteous as humanly possible, ask them what their concerns were 
about your profile. For future applications, modify your covering letter 
copy to address any issues that they raise.






//////5. Interview Well
If your applications go well, with a bit of luck you should 
be invited to interview at least once.

If you've made it this far
you're most of the way to securing an offer. 

If they weren't interested in hiring you, 
they wouldn't invite you in for interview.

There are as many types of interview as there are companies that hire programmers. 

There are highly technical slogging matches, going through 
data structures and ERDs on whiteboards. 

There are entirely non-technical interviews that speak in very 
broad terms about your history and abilities.

They can be one-on-one, two-on-one or with a panel. 

You might have pre-interview programming challenges or multiple phone 
screens before you're even called in to interview.

With all this variation, it can be difficult to plan a general strategy 
for success at interview for a programming job.


Most interviewers are worse at interviewing than you are at attending interviews.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make yourself monstrously hireable in spite of all of the above.


Interviews for programming work typically contain the following 
elements in some order:

Non-technical questions for you
Questions you have for them
Technical challenges for you to complete

to help you find out how well the company does against your own personal criteria.

////Questions for you
The non-technical part of the interview is where you have opportunity 
after opportunity to demonstrate the value you would bring to a given 
organization. Your job is to seek out these opportunities and exploit them, 
for both your benefit and the interviewers.

No one hiring developers wakes up in the morning and says to themselves 
"I don't want to meet a technically competent candidate who can communicate 
as well as he can write code today."

Do a quick exercise: in your notebook write a list of the questions you 
think interviewers might ask you. What would you ask if you were hiring 
you and were given your CV? I'll do the exercise for myself right 
here as an example, but your questions will be different:

Tell me about your work history.
What experience do you have with Ruby on Rails?
It says here you can speak fluent Japanese, you're kidding, right?
What was your experience at #{past company} like?
What's a technically challenging thing you've worked on recently?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Where do you see yourself in five years time?
Are you more of a front end or back end developer?
What sort of role do you play on a development team?


For each of the questions you come up with, have an answer prepared. 
You can write out your answers in detail if you prefer
you can have a note book of the answer point to catch on in the interview

The goal is not to recite prepared answers to all possible questions, 
but simply to get in the mindset of talking confidently about your experience 
and skills.

Have stories to tell about your experiences so far, the technology 
you've used and the software you've built. Try to weave together a 
narrative about your work experience that the interviewer can follow easily.

There may be questions you haven't prepared for, 
but after thinking through answers for a good sample, 
you should be able to tackle most non-technical questions with confidence.

Where possible, you want to highlight skills and experience that are 
directly relevant to the work you would be doing at the interviewers company.




//////Questions for them
This is a chance to express what's important to you and demonstrate more value.

The company you're thinking about working for and what their goals are
The working conditions, technology, process and culture
The software that you will be building, and why you will be building it
Everything that was important to you about the role, as highlighted in your qualification stage.


Go to their website and find out what it is they do, 
how they make money and what their core values are. Play with their website 
(for bonus points, see if you can break it). 
Find out as much about them as you can.


Tell me about some software you've delivered to users in the past month.
(Do you regularly deliver working software?)
How do you measure the impact of your software on end users?
(How do you know what you're building is what your users actually need?)
Are you profitable?
(How secure is this job?)
Why are you hiring developers now?
How is developer time spread between maintenance and building new features?
(Am I going to be spending the majority of my time fighting fires?)
Tell me about your technology stack and architecture.
How do you organize developer work? Do you use an iterative development process?
What's the development teams stance on documentation? Unit testing? Code reviews?
What major projects is the development team working on at the moment? What's the strategic motivation behind them?
I see you're using {some tech} for {some task}, what made you choose it? How has your experience been with it so far?
How much downtime have you experienced in the past six months? Can you walk me through how you would respond to your website going down right now?
(Will I be expected to fix the website on weekends/late at night?)
Do you do user experience or A/B testing?
Do you have automated acceptance tests and dedicated QA?
Does the development team get time to improve the quality of the software?
(Will we have time to drain the swamp?)

sample of example questions
choose and add about things you care about from the list of priorities you made for yourself


Since you also took a bunch of notes about the organization, put together 
some questions specific to them. You're not interrogating them about the 
company here, just trying to get them to talk about their problems, 
day-to-day activities and things they would like to change or have done better. 
The more you can get them to talk about themselves, the better.


//////Technical Challenges
in a technical interview the only thing you can do 
is control your response to the situation as it is.

//situation: I lack completely the knowledge or skill to tackle this problem.
come clean straight away and let the interviewer know that your skillset 
doesn't extend to solving this particular problem.


//situation: I can probably solve this problem, 
but may need help/documentation along the way

Again, be honest. Tell the interviewer what you're not clear on, 
and repeat the problem back to them. Work through it with them rather
than attempt to solve the problem on your own.

In a good interview, most of the questions should be at this difficulty. 
Watching you apply your technical skills along with your creative and 
intellectual faculties to a non-trivial problem is the exact reason 
interviewers conduct technical challenges, so go slowly and make the most of it.


//situation: Give me 20 seconds... done!
Smaller coding problems like fizzbuzz, 'implement select without select' or 'implement 
a function that counts all the instances of each class in an array' are the 
sorts of problems you should quite literally be able to do with your eyes closed.

These sorts of programming challenges are a great opportunity to show off your 
skills with a little flamboyance. You could write a quick unit test for any 
function you're asked to write or show off a subtle language feature that 
they may not have heard of.

More random advice for doing well at these technical challenges:
Bring your own laptop.
Be honest about your skills.
If you get confused or nervous, take a break
Confirm your assumptions.

After the interview follow up





//////6. Compare Offers

You should have at least three offers at companies you would like to spend 
the next few years with in hand before making a decision. 

I think you should have multiple offers because:
Multiple offers give you more confidence.

helps to change your mindset from:
"Please give me this job, I'll work ever so hard for you!"
to:
"Let's find out what we have to offer each other."

The first is born of desperation, the second of the desire to exchange 
value as equals. Which do you think a potential hirer (worth working for) 
will prefer?


//Multiple offers allow (some degree) of playing offers against each other.
not just about salary
if you want to get something you want in the job, this is the time to ask it
not after you've accepted

You often won't need to do this sort of negotiating actively. 
Interviewers will ask if you have other offers or are interviewing elsewhere. 
If you've followed my advice, you should answer positively to both of those 
questions and give them details on the other offers, along with your reasoning 
about why you might pick one offer over others.


//The act of getting multiple offers teaches you more.
by going through all the interviews
you will have much more technical context about
how different types of development teams work
which can only be a good thing for you

Whatever you do, don't accept the first offer made to you straight away. 
Tell them you need at least a few weeks to think about it and ignore any 
high-pressure sales tactics ("we need a decision by tomorrow!") 
they throw in your direction. If they want to hire you, they'll wait.

With the offers in hand, all that's left is to compare them based on the 
criteria you listed at the beginning of this process.

(Side note: In my experience at least, outside of finance, 
full-time technical jobs tend to go up in quality with salary, 
especially at startups).

but for the long-term, nothing beats having a network of other 
developers/potential clients at your back when you're looking for work. 
You should take steps, starting today, to build that network and treat 
everyone in it like solid gold.

Employers that are hiring fresh grads or career changers usually aren't hiring 
for technical skills. What they are looking for is the ability to think critically 
and learn quickly. By showing your passion for learning about technology, 
you can really stand above the crowd.

1. Remember that you're the product.
use sales and marketing techniques

Understand five strengths and three weaknesses about yourself and be able 
to share your experiences with others in the form of a story

If there is a personal connection to the project or this is your life-long 
interest or purpose, people love to hear about it,



2. Know what you want.
The tech community is welcoming, friendly and helpful. 
Make it easier for others to help you quickly and effectively

That means having a clear-cut sense of your skill set and what you want in a job and an employer.


3. Always be prepared for a job opportunity.
Always have your resume, portfolio and Github updated and always 
be working on a project or improving your skills," 

Make sure your portfolio links are working, and be ready to explain 
your work effectively and succinctly

keeping three to five questions ready about the companies you're interested in; 
employers want to know you're interested in them and have done your homework.

4. Curate the content you read and watch.
start -- and follow companies and individual influencers on social media. 
Coursera, Udacity, Udemy and iTunes U as examples of where to look.


5. Get involved online.
Be involved in online open source communities (such as Github and Dribbble) 
and contribute your ideas to online forums and groups such as Quora and LinkedIn

Connect with and introduce yourself to [IT professionals] via social media 
[who work] at your list of companies


6. Develop personal projects that showcase your IT chops.

7. Consider the challenges potential employers face.

Most tech companies I've encountered are interested in sponsoring visas 
if they can afford to. The demand for engineers in the US is such that the 
local talent can't satisfy it.

A visa can cost companies anywhere between $2,500 to $10,000 in legal and 
USCIS fees to sponsor. Compared to an engineer's salary, this isn't usually 
a problem for companies — especially if they've raised some outside capital.

I find that usually any objections to sponsoring a visa boil down to 
the time costs, rather than anything else.

I suggest coming out to SF on your own accord, staying for a short while, 
and lining up a bunch of interviews with all the companies you're interested in.

you have to have a job offer to get the visa.

Some visas are dual intent (meaning you can have intent to stay permanently), 
and some of them are only meant to be temporary. 
This is an important distinction to make, and will affect your ability 
to get a green card in the future.

After 4 months of funemployment, 25 job applications and 6 weeks of 
constant interviewing, I’ve finally got a job at >Stripe.

Firstly, find the right level of confidence.

Secondly, everything becomes much easier when you accept that some 
people and some companies are better or worse at interviewing candidates 
than others, and that at this point in time it’s your job to play the ball 
as it lies.

I applied to 25 companies
17 asked me to do phone interviews, 8 either never replied or said no thanks straightaway
7 asked me to go to San Francisco for an on site interview
5 made me an offer

The internet does not do a good job of reminding you that very few people 
are programmatic celebrities and that you don’t have to be a polyglot or a 
prodigy in order to be an incredibly good hire. Even if you are “just” 
good at building stable, maintainable and vanilla Rails apps, you are still 
a very rare breed.

For almost all positions, open source contributions and active StackOverflow 
and Github profiles are just one of many nice-to-haves. Even if you do have a 
bunch of projects and other content on display, they’ll be used to evaluate 
your code quality, not your all-consuming passion for programming. 
Companies are aware that not everyone wants or is able to work on OSS, 
and if you don’t have any public code then they’ll just look at other 
indications of your skills instead.

you will still need to show a company in person that you can write good code 
and will be reasonable to work with.

If a position and company look fun, then apply, even if you don’t meet any of 
their requirements. The worst they can say is no, and the best they can say is 
“sure, let’s talk”, whereupon you can show them why you are awesome in 10 ways 
they hadn’t even thought of.


1.3 Yes, there is an "Engineer Crunch"
there are lots of jobs for engineers but not enough people with the skills 
to do them all. This means you will probably be able to get your feet in a 
lot of interesting doors.

1.4 But it's not that Crunchy
you can still be rejected,
because companies still have to hire people that fit their needs


//////2. Making applications
Whilst first impressions do matter, your cover letter/CV will quickly get 
forgotten when you start talking code, so all they really have to do is get 
you in the door and maybe be a bit memorable

2.3 Spreadsheet
Keep a spreadsheet with:

The company name
The date you applied
How much you like the company (scale of 1-4, use conditional formatting to colour-code)
The stage you are at (Applied/Phone Hello/Phone Tech/On Site/Offered)
If a company rejects you, move them to a separate list. You need to be able to see at a glance how many live applications you have and how many of them are actually interesting to you. Anything not on the above list is unnecessary and won’t get updated, so will just make your spreadsheet stale and less communicative.
