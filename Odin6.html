*ability to put together a content-managed website.
*proof that I could actually deliver on a CMS soon after the interview.

*CRUD application with PHP/MySQL


I taught myself about [HTTP][http-rfc], managing complexity and version control. 
I invested in touch-typing, learned how to use vim to an intermediate level 
and received a harsh introduction to the world of web application security.

extend yourself


received an offer for a permanent full-time role for a salary of £21,000 per annum 
(roughly $34,000 USD). At the time I knew this wasn't a great salary.
that is 87E$

next job
salary stayed in the £20k-£30k ($34k-$48k) range. work and doing freelance work

next job after a year and a half
two offers in hand. Both were at £38k ($61k)

recruiter had submitted me for a position as a "senior" developer. 
At this stage I had roughly two years of experience developing web professionally, 
and would never have had the confidence to apply as a senior developer on my own.


////Senior interview:
grilled on every skill listed on my CV. In each instance I was questioned 
until I had to say "I don't know, but I'd search the documentation/rfc/google 
for x to find out".

I was given mock scenarios for high-scalability web applications, asked 
to "explain polymorphism without reference to animals or shapes

and had to talk through a code review with developers from the team, 
spotting badly chosen algorithms, subtle errors and bad coding style with as 
much politeness as I could muster.
topics like composition over inheritance

I was invited back for a second interview in a few days where 
I was to give a presentation on a technical topic of my choosing 
(out of a list of possible options). I went with hash tables as 
I remembered a thing or two about them from university and could piece 
together the rest from wikipedia.


I made it clear that the presentation would very much be a condensed version 
of the wikipedia article before starting, and then spoke for around ten minutes 
on the topic. After the presentation I was again grilled, this time on favorable 
properties of hashing functions, common problems, possible solutions etc. 
I had done my research and was prepared for the initial barrage, 
but it wasn't long before my knowledge on the subject ran dry.


I again went home, this time quite sure that I wouldn't get the offer from Bravo. 
I didn't have enough experience to be a "senior" developer and I felt my knowledge 
bottomed out in the interview far too often.

Around a week later, the recruiter got back to me to let me know that Bravo 
wanted to bring me on as a senior developer for £44,000 per annum ($70k), 
more than double the salary I started on as a web developer only two years ago.
180k/m, 2.1m/y

It was such a huge jump for me that I felt like there was some catch, 
some downside that I had missed because I didn't quite deserve this level of 
compensation just yet.

I accepted the offer. Working at Bravo was by far the hardest and most educational 
technical job I've yet to experience. Among other things, we had:


A polyglot codebase (PHP/ActionScript for the web front-end, Java for back-end services)


My job had been to have my assumptions questioned, hard, by people who 
were a lot smarter than me.
After that, not only was I capable of having strong technical opinions, 
I was able to articulate them clearly.
while working started to feel a lot more confident in my abilities by the end of my time there.


//////Finding your first few web developer jobs
Over the course of my career I've applied to more openings, 
attended more interviews and turned down more offers than I can honestly remember. 

1. Start building assets that make you more hirable
2. Collect information on a large number of job openings to get a feel for the market
3. Prioritize the leads based on a set of criteria, personal to you
4. Apply to the most attractive leads based on your criteria with a CV, and covering letter.
5. Prepare for and give a good interview when invited
6. Only make a decision when you have at least three offers in hand.


just make sure you are accepting what you would mostly get at this point
not take it on faith from someone who benefits from you accepting a lower salary.


//////1. Build Advantages

Before you start the application process, 
you need to have a number of advantages


1) Social Proof. 
If you've been hired by three other companies in the past, 
have a string of testimonials and the battle scars to show for them, 
you become a lot easier to hire.

Building a network of professionals that can vouch for you not only 
makes you more valuable in the eyes of potential hirers, it also gives 
you a lot of confidence going into an interview.

Actionable advice: Get hired as a web developer and spend a few years 
doing a good job of it. Failing that, attend local user groups and 
tech-scene events, meet people in real life and try to impart something 
of value when you do.




2) Technical Depth. 
I believe that anyone who works programming computers should 
"know what they don't know" about the entire stack

Actionable advice: Read about the job of programming and take steps 
to get better at it. Learn about OS fundamentals, object oriented design patterns, 
functional programming, network protocols, 
finite state automata, data structures + algorithms and whatever 
the hell else you can get your hands on.



3)Technical Skill
it does not matter what tool you use 
as long as you know those tools well

Also, learning to use a VCS (e.g. git) is a prerequisite for any programming job 
in the 21st century.

Actionable advice: Use deliberate practice to get better at building software. 
There's a difference between knowing the perfect recipe for a roast chicken and 
having the skill to debone one in sixty seconds. If there's any technical 
skill you can think of that you're worried about not having, chase it down, 
practice it and own it.

Some examples might be getting better at modifying code in your favorite 
text editor, learning how to set up and configure a web server by hand, 
doing non-trivial joins in SQL or improving your abilities at the 
terminal with coreutils.


4) A Web Presence
If I go to your personal homepage, is there an easy way for me to find about 
your expertise? Do you have a profile on LinkedIn that I can read through 
to find out about your experience and skillset? Can I at least get a 
hold of your CV? 
You don't need to be a prolific blogger

Actionable advice: Build a website that shows off you skills, 
experience and portfolio, making sure it links to other places on the 
internet where you can be found. This could be a single page with an intro, 
contact information and sections headed 'skills', 'experience', 'portfolio' 
and 'links'. Don't spend forever on this, just get that single page up, 
make it look half decent and move on.

5)Working Software, publicly available
Hirers just want to confirm that you can code at all. 
Make this easy for them by building things and putting the things you 
built where they can see them.


Actionable advice: Spend a little time brainstorming potential portfolio pieces, 
pick the most interesting project out of your list and build it. The smaller 
and easier to complete, the better. Once you've finished, make it available 
at a public URL and host the code on github. Repeat twice for best results.

None of these advantages are things that you can build overnight. 
They take consistent effort over the course of at least a month. 
Without them, it will be difficult to secure an interview.



//////2. Collect Leads

Using Highrise, a text file or some paper filing system, create a list of leads. 
For each lead list:

Name of the company if known
Contact information for sending an application
A URL to the job listing if applicable

Good sources for leads, in order of preference:
Your personal network
Direct Applications
Job Boards
Recruiters

for leads from your network
nicely worded email to everyone in your circle
informing them of your current situation
the kind of work you're looking for
and link to your personal homepage (where hirers can find out more about you)

To find out what companies are hiring technical staff, it's worth looking for 
places that already list companies that build software. Silicon Milk Roundabout, 
Techcrunch, YC Alumni, client lists of software consultancies or anywhere else 
software companies are listed will do the trick. For each list, 
visit the companies website, look for their 'jobs' section and add any 
potential leads to your list.

Authentic Jobs
Github Jobs
StackOverflow Jobs
Hacker Jobs UK
CWJobs

Try to resist the urge to apply straight away. 
At the moment the goal is to collect a large swathe of leads to get a 
feel for the technical employment market right now.


treat recruiters like any other lead, log the job spec and continue. 
Before working with recruiters on a real-life opening, 
I would strongly recommend reading Secrets of Power Negotiating by Roger Dawson. 
It lists in detail exactly the sort of tactics that recruiters will use 
when dealing with you. Best to go into any business with recruiters 
with your eyes wide open.






//////3. Qualify Leads: 
Make a list of criteria for prioritizing opportunities

When looking at a job prospect, different 
things are important to different people.

list of questions that I ask myself about a given lead to qualify it:

A) Are you likely to secure an offer? are you fit for the role?

B) Will your skills and knowledge progress (in the direction you want them to)?
If you want to level up as a developer, you won't be challenged if you're 
building content managed websites forever. Based on what the company does 
and the sort of technical tasks it will entail, will you have passion for the work?

C) Will the job pay you enough?
any job you apply to needs to pay you enough so that money isn't an issue for you.

D)Is the job secure enough?
 Do you want to be the first hire in an early stage startup? A new member of an established technical team?

E) Am I going to be productive with this company? 
Will they have some sort  of iterative development process or is 
it the same chaos that most companies that happen to need programmers 
find themselves in?


Add or remove questions as you see fit. Remote work may be an important factor 
for you if you don't live near a major city. You might prefer to work with 
many clients in a consultancy, or work on an in-house development team 
responsible for both new features and maintenance. You might have a 
preference for front-end over back-end work.

Based on your collection of leads you should have a good idea of the sort 
of jobs available to you in the current market, so you can adjust your 
criteria accordingly.

Your list doesn't need to be a iron-clad; we're just trying to figure out 
what's important to you in any potential job opening. When looking for a 
job it can be quite tempting to accept whatever offer comes your way. 
Knowing what's important to you before you even make an application 
should help you keep focused on your own priorities rather than 
those of the companies trying to hire you.

Once you have a good idea of what's important to you, take your shortlist 
of leads and remove any that have no chance of meeting your criteria.

You don't want to rule out too many leads, just the ones that are obviously 
not a good fit for you.

It can be difficult to assess suitability without having an in-person meeting, 
so be liberal in what you let through for now.



//////4. Make Applications

For each of your leads that have made it through your qualification stage, 
you're going to apply with a CV and a short email.

To begin, you'll need to put a CV together that highlights all the 
advantages you've built up. To reiterate, those include technical depth, 
technical skill, social proof and working software.

For social proof you might list some of the companies you've worked for 
and/or testimonials you've received from past colleagues. This could be 
for jobs that are non-technical if you have no relevant full-time experience.

For technical depth/skill you could highlight some of the technologies you've 
worked with and can reason about at different levels of abstraction. 
You'll should be able to talk confidently about anything you list here, 
and and demonstrate relevant skill in an interview.

For working software you should link to either a working installation of 
an application that you created or a code sample that you were responsible 
for. Make this easy to find and preview.

2-5 examples of each of the above will go a long way towards making your 
case to hirers selecting candidates for interview.

While the core content and stories of your CV should remain the same, 
it's worth customizing it to specific job descriptions. 
If you're applying for a job that will entail statistics 
and machine learning, you might choose a different set of sample projects 
than you would if you were applying for job building e-commerce websites.



You'll also need to write a brief covering email along with your CV, 
highlighting your suitability for the role.


If you're missing a major requirement listed in the job spec, ignoring 
it is the worst thing you can do. Your best shot at making up for any 
shortcomings is to address them directly and highlight your will and 
ability to learn fast and not be a burden on your future team. 
The covering letter is a good a place as any to do this.


an example below of the sort of covering letter 
I might send over as a fresh-faced newbie

/////////////
Hi Alice,

I'm Bob, a web developer currently available for full-time employment.

According to your company website, you're currently hiring web developers. Based on the information outlined there, I believe I would make a good addition to your team.

You might notice that I don't have any commercial experience, so I would be applying to this role as a junior developer. While I've never worked as a full-time web developer before, I'm proficient with many of the technologies listed in your requirements, have deployed working software and believe I would contribute value to your development team from day one.

Please find attached my CV with links to code samples and projects that demonstrate my abilities. Additionally, you can see my profile on github here: http://github.com/example-example-example

It would be great to meet for a chat at some point if you have any interest in taking this further.

Kind Regards,

-Bob, http://bobthewebdeveloper.example.com/
/////////////


Don't just copy this blindly and hope. Mention reasons why 
you're a good fit for the role/company
if you're not and you don't, then you should be and you should.


For each application, log the date that you applied in your lead filing system 
and be sure to follow up via email a set number of days later. 
My follow up schedule (assuming no response) is three days, 
one further week and an additional two further weeks before giving up on a lead. 
There are a million reasons why a potential hirer may forget to get back to you, 
so make it easy for them to remember. Follow up.


Take care with each application and make only three or four at a time. 
Applying to every one of your leads at the same time can be confusing 
for you and won't help you to make as good an impression as possible on each hirer. 
Wait a week before applying to more, and feel free to update your leads list 
based on new opportunities or information.

If they come back with a rejection, use it as an opportunity to learn. 
Being as courteous as humanly possible, ask them what their concerns were 
about your profile. For future applications, modify your covering letter 
copy to address any issues that they raise.






//////5. Interview Well
If your applications go well, with a bit of luck you should 
be invited to interview at least once.

If you've made it this far
you're most of the way to securing an offer. 

If they weren't interested in hiring you, 
they wouldn't invite you in for interview.

There are as many types of interview as there are companies that hire programmers. 

There are highly technical slogging matches, going through 
data structures and ERDs on whiteboards. 

There are entirely non-technical interviews that speak in very 
broad terms about your history and abilities.

They can be one-on-one, two-on-one or with a panel. 

You might have pre-interview programming challenges or multiple phone 
screens before you're even called in to interview.

With all this variation, it can be difficult to plan a general strategy 
for success at interview for a programming job.


Most interviewers are worse at interviewing than you are at attending interviews.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make yourself monstrously hireable in spite of all of the above.


Interviews for programming work typically contain the following 
elements in some order:

Non-technical questions for you
Questions you have for them
Technical challenges for you to complete

to help you find out how well the company does against your own personal criteria.

////Questions for you
The non-technical part of the interview is where you have opportunity 
after opportunity to demonstrate the value you would bring to a given 
organization. Your job is to seek out these opportunities and exploit them, 
for both your benefit and the interviewers.

No one hiring developers wakes up in the morning and says to themselves 
"I don't want to meet a technically competent candidate who can communicate 
as well as he can write code today."

Do a quick exercise: in your notebook write a list of the questions you 
think interviewers might ask you. What would you ask if you were hiring 
you and were given your CV? I'll do the exercise for myself right 
here as an example, but your questions will be different:

Tell me about your work history.
What experience do you have with Ruby on Rails?
It says here you can speak fluent Japanese, you're kidding, right?
What was your experience at #{past company} like?
What's a technically challenging thing you've worked on recently?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Where do you see yourself in five years time?
Are you more of a front end or back end developer?
What sort of role do you play on a development team?


For each of the questions you come up with, have an answer prepared. 
You can write out your answers in detail if you prefer
you can have a note book of the answer point to catch on in the interview

The goal is not to recite prepared answers to all possible questions, 
but simply to get in the mindset of talking confidently about your experience 
and skills.

Have stories to tell about your experiences so far, the technology 
you've used and the software you've built. Try to weave together a 
narrative about your work experience that the interviewer can follow easily.

There may be questions you haven't prepared for, 
but after thinking through answers for a good sample, 
you should be able to tackle most non-technical questions with confidence.

Where possible, you want to highlight skills and experience that are 
directly relevant to the work you would be doing at the interviewers company.




//////Questions for them
This is a chance to express what's important to you and demonstrate more value.

The company you're thinking about working for and what their goals are
The working conditions, technology, process and culture
The software that you will be building, and why you will be building it
Everything that was important to you about the role, as highlighted in your qualification stage.


Go to their website and find out what it is they do, 
how they make money and what their core values are. Play with their website 
(for bonus points, see if you can break it). 
Find out as much about them as you can.


Tell me about some software you've delivered to users in the past month.
(Do you regularly deliver working software?)
How do you measure the impact of your software on end users?
(How do you know what you're building is what your users actually need?)
Are you profitable?
(How secure is this job?)
Why are you hiring developers now?
How is developer time spread between maintenance and building new features?
(Am I going to be spending the majority of my time fighting fires?)
Tell me about your technology stack and architecture.
How do you organize developer work? Do you use an iterative development process?
What's the development teams stance on documentation? Unit testing? Code reviews?
What major projects is the development team working on at the moment? What's the strategic motivation behind them?
I see you're using {some tech} for {some task}, what made you choose it? How has your experience been with it so far?
How much downtime have you experienced in the past six months? Can you walk me through how you would respond to your website going down right now?
(Will I be expected to fix the website on weekends/late at night?)
Do you do user experience or A/B testing?
Do you have automated acceptance tests and dedicated QA?
Does the development team get time to improve the quality of the software?
(Will we have time to drain the swamp?)

sample of example questions
choose and add about things you care about from the list of priorities you made for yourself


Since you also took a bunch of notes about the organization, put together 
some questions specific to them. You're not interrogating them about the 
company here, just trying to get them to talk about their problems, 
day-to-day activities and things they would like to change or have done better. 
The more you can get them to talk about themselves, the better.


//////Technical Challenges
in a technical interview the only thing you can do 
is control your response to the situation as it is.

//situation: I lack completely the knowledge or skill to tackle this problem.
come clean straight away and let the interviewer know that your skillset 
doesn't extend to solving this particular problem.


//situation: I can probably solve this problem, 
but may need help/documentation along the way

Again, be honest. Tell the interviewer what you're not clear on, 
and repeat the problem back to them. Work through it with them rather
than attempt to solve the problem on your own.

In a good interview, most of the questions should be at this difficulty. 
Watching you apply your technical skills along with your creative and 
intellectual faculties to a non-trivial problem is the exact reason 
interviewers conduct technical challenges, so go slowly and make the most of it.


//situation: Give me 20 seconds... done!
Smaller coding problems like fizzbuzz, 'implement select without select' or 'implement 
a function that counts all the instances of each class in an array' are the 
sorts of problems you should quite literally be able to do with your eyes closed.

These sorts of programming challenges are a great opportunity to show off your 
skills with a little flamboyance. You could write a quick unit test for any 
function you're asked to write or show off a subtle language feature that 
they may not have heard of.

More random advice for doing well at these technical challenges:
Bring your own laptop.
Be honest about your skills.
If you get confused or nervous, take a break
Confirm your assumptions.

After the interview follow up





//////6. Compare Offers

You should have at least three offers at companies you would like to spend 
the next few years with in hand before making a decision. 

I think you should have multiple offers because:
Multiple offers give you more confidence.

helps to change your mindset from:
"Please give me this job, I'll work ever so hard for you!"
to:
"Let's find out what we have to offer each other."

The first is born of desperation, the second of the desire to exchange 
value as equals. Which do you think a potential hirer (worth working for) 
will prefer?


//Multiple offers allow (some degree) of playing offers against each other.
not just about salary
if you want to get something you want in the job, this is the time to ask it
not after you've accepted

You often won't need to do this sort of negotiating actively. 
Interviewers will ask if you have other offers or are interviewing elsewhere. 
If you've followed my advice, you should answer positively to both of those 
questions and give them details on the other offers, along with your reasoning 
about why you might pick one offer over others.


//The act of getting multiple offers teaches you more.
by going through all the interviews
you will have much more technical context about
how different types of development teams work
which can only be a good thing for you

Whatever you do, don't accept the first offer made to you straight away. 
Tell them you need at least a few weeks to think about it and ignore any 
high-pressure sales tactics ("we need a decision by tomorrow!") 
they throw in your direction. If they want to hire you, they'll wait.

With the offers in hand, all that's left is to compare them based on the 
criteria you listed at the beginning of this process.

(Side note: In my experience at least, outside of finance, 
full-time technical jobs tend to go up in quality with salary, 
especially at startups).

but for the long-term, nothing beats having a network of other 
developers/potential clients at your back when you're looking for work. 
You should take steps, starting today, to build that network and treat 
everyone in it like solid gold.

Employers that are hiring fresh grads or career changers usually aren't hiring 
for technical skills. What they are looking for is the ability to think critically 
and learn quickly. By showing your passion for learning about technology, 
you can really stand above the crowd.

1. Remember that you're the product.
use sales and marketing techniques

Understand five strengths and three weaknesses about yourself and be able 
to share your experiences with others in the form of a story

If there is a personal connection to the project or this is your life-long 
interest or purpose, people love to hear about it,



2. Know what you want.
The tech community is welcoming, friendly and helpful. 
Make it easier for others to help you quickly and effectively

That means having a clear-cut sense of your skill set and what you want in a job and an employer.


3. Always be prepared for a job opportunity.
Always have your resume, portfolio and Github updated and always 
be working on a project or improving your skills," 

Make sure your portfolio links are working, and be ready to explain 
your work effectively and succinctly

keeping three to five questions ready about the companies you're interested in; 
employers want to know you're interested in them and have done your homework.

4. Curate the content you read and watch.
start -- and follow companies and individual influencers on social media. 
Coursera, Udacity, Udemy and iTunes U as examples of where to look.


5. Get involved online.
Be involved in online open source communities (such as Github and Dribbble) 
and contribute your ideas to online forums and groups such as Quora and LinkedIn

Connect with and introduce yourself to [IT professionals] via social media 
[who work] at your list of companies


6. Develop personal projects that showcase your IT chops.

7. Consider the challenges potential employers face.

Most tech companies I've encountered are interested in sponsoring visas 
if they can afford to. The demand for engineers in the US is such that the 
local talent can't satisfy it.

A visa can cost companies anywhere between $2,500 to $10,000 in legal and 
USCIS fees to sponsor. Compared to an engineer's salary, this isn't usually 
a problem for companies — especially if they've raised some outside capital.

I find that usually any objections to sponsoring a visa boil down to 
the time costs, rather than anything else.

I suggest coming out to SF on your own accord, staying for a short while, 
and lining up a bunch of interviews with all the companies you're interested in.

you have to have a job offer to get the visa.

Some visas are dual intent (meaning you can have intent to stay permanently), 
and some of them are only meant to be temporary. 
This is an important distinction to make, and will affect your ability 
to get a green card in the future.

After 4 months of funemployment, 25 job applications and 6 weeks of 
constant interviewing, I’ve finally got a job at >Stripe.

Firstly, find the right level of confidence.

Secondly, everything becomes much easier when you accept that some 
people and some companies are better or worse at interviewing candidates 
than others, and that at this point in time it’s your job to play the ball 
as it lies.

I applied to 25 companies
17 asked me to do phone interviews, 8 either never replied or said no thanks straightaway
7 asked me to go to San Francisco for an on site interview
5 made me an offer

The internet does not do a good job of reminding you that very few people 
are programmatic celebrities and that you don’t have to be a polyglot or a 
prodigy in order to be an incredibly good hire. Even if you are “just” 
good at building stable, maintainable and vanilla Rails apps, you are still 
a very rare breed.

For almost all positions, open source contributions and active StackOverflow 
and Github profiles are just one of many nice-to-haves. Even if you do have a 
bunch of projects and other content on display, they’ll be used to evaluate 
your code quality, not your all-consuming passion for programming. 
Companies are aware that not everyone wants or is able to work on OSS, 
and if you don’t have any public code then they’ll just look at other 
indications of your skills instead.

you will still need to show a company in person that you can write good code 
and will be reasonable to work with.

If a position and company look fun, then apply, even if you don’t meet any of 
their requirements. The worst they can say is no, and the best they can say is 
“sure, let’s talk”, whereupon you can show them why you are awesome in 10 ways 
they hadn’t even thought of.


1.3 Yes, there is an "Engineer Crunch"
there are lots of jobs for engineers but not enough people with the skills 
to do them all. This means you will probably be able to get your feet in a 
lot of interesting doors.

1.4 But it's not that Crunchy
you can still be rejected,
because companies still have to hire people that fit their needs


//////2. Making applications
Whilst first impressions do matter, your cover letter/CV will quickly get 
forgotten when you start talking code, so all they really have to do is get 
you in the door and maybe be a bit memorable

2.3 Spreadsheet
Keep a spreadsheet with:

The company name
The date you applied
How much you like the company (scale of 1-4, use conditional formatting to colour-code)
The stage you are at (Applied/Phone Hello/Phone Tech/On Site/Offered)
If a company rejects you, move them to a separate list. You need to be able to see at a glance how many live applications you have and how many of them are actually interesting to you. Anything not on the above list is unnecessary and won’t get updated, so will just make your spreadsheet stale and less communicative.


2.4 Where to look
Hacker News Who’s Hiring thread
AngelList - like a dating site theme
LinkedIn - mostly spammy recruiters, small number in-house recruiters
    protip: set your location to where you are looking before you get there

Hired.com - this seems like a very interesting model, particularly for engineers. 
I was on auction for a week and received 8 credible-looking offers with actual 
proposed dollar amounts. None of the products felt like a fit for me, but the 
process was very easy and potentially disproportionately rewarding. 
In the worst case you still get some idea of your market value, although 
I would suggest only using your shot on it once you are in a position 
to actually follow up with any interesting offers.

Intros/direct applications - these will still likely make up the 
bulk of the top of your funnel. I made 10 applications this way.


2.5 Inbound interest
https://robertheaton.com/old-hire-me/




//////3. General Interviews
If you don’t have several interviews where you get completely annihilated 
(I had 3), then you probably didn’t make enough speculative applications.

If they make a mistake and it takes them an hour to work out that you are 
actually completely unsuited for the job then that’s not a big deal.

Once you hear how much recruiters’ fees are then you won’t feel bad or 
embarrassed when talking to a company ever again.


3.2 Standard general questions
You will inevitably gradually evolve your answers to the standard questions:

Tell me about yourself.
What are you looking for in your next:
Product?
Team? (size, culture etc)
Technical challenge?
Have you had experience scaling applications?
Tell me about a cool project you worked on recently (very important).


//3.3 You might think that some companies suck at interviews

But it’s not worth getting upset about. At pretty much every company you will 
be answering a series of 45-60 min code-oriented challenges, with a few 
curveballs thrown in for variety. Some of these will be purely algorithmic 
(although very rarely a standard, rote algorithm like merge sort), 
and some will be more focussed on architecture. 
But regardless, you will spend much of your interview time writing code. 
If this doesn’t appeal to you then, unfortunately, you will just have to get 
practicing.

Many companies include a 2-3 hour take-home technical challenge as part of their phone screen process.


//3.4 Systems design questions
Most companies will ask a question about designing a high-level (often distributed) 
system - what machines would you use, how would you arrange them, how would you 
deal with failures, how would you set up your database etc. If, like me, you have 
little practical experience with this stuff, then don’t lose any sleep over it. 
It’s all surprisingly logical and non-magical, and you can stumble through 
the problem, learn a few things, and reach a broadly sensible answer.

3.5 The one question I will give away
“Design the infrastructure for a link-shortener.”
“If I type https://google.com into my browser and press enter, what happens?”

You can talk about so many things on so many levels - DNS lookup, IP lookup, 
client/server-side caching, SSL/TLS and many more. A fun question to answer.


3.7 Do your own write-ups
In the current market, the engineering interview process is arguably more about 
you choosing a company than a company choosing you. Every interviewer you speak 
to will be writing detailed notes on you after you finish with them, and you 
should do exactly the same. All you need is a document in Evernote - 
“FooCorp Phone Interview 1/1/14” - with details of what they asked, 
what you replied, whether you liked the person, whether you liked the 
sound of the company, the answers to any questions you asked them and 
what the next steps are. You will forget all of this information within 
a couple of hours, so do it immediately after you finish.

3.8 Find out next steps
At the end of every phone and on-site interview, make sure you know exactly 
what the next steps are and when they will contact you by. This will make your 
planning far easier and will help in the follow up


//////4 Phone interviews
Phone interviews are surprisingly tiring. Don’t arrange too many in a 
row and make sure to give yourself breaks.


4.2 Things to learn
“Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for multiples 
of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five 
print “FizzBuzz”.”

It’s not a trick question, it really is as easy as it sounds, so just do it. 
Small gotcha: remember that for(var i=0; i<=100; i++) is technically wrong - 
you should be starting at 1, not 0.

Other common screening-type questions include the properties of common data 
structures (hashes, arrays, sets, trees, binary-search trees) and Big O 
complexities. It’s worth learning that sorting a array of N elements 
takes O(Nlog(N)) time, finding an element in a sorted array takes O(log(N)) 
time, and that the sum of the numbers from 1 to N (the actual sum, not the 
time taken to calculate this sum) is O(N^2). Pro-tip: the fact that 
Hashes have O(1) lookup time is often a great way to speed up an algorithm.

review depth-/breadth-first search, bit-shifting, programming language properties, 
and all the other things you haven’t thought about since CS 101 though. 
Again, it may upset you that these things aren’t directly related to what you’ll 
be doing on a day-to-day basis, but it’s what you’re mostly going to be asked about.


//////5. On-site interviews
//5.1 Length and energy
on site interviews are long can take 6 hours
ask if you can get something to eat or drink if you need one

5.2 Other people
If a company likes you, they’ll make you an offer, regardless of whether 
they dis/like someone else. So you don’t need to focus on other candidates

5.3 Misc
The first on-site interview of your job search won’t necessarily be terrible, 
but it will be much worse than your last.


//////6. Post-interview

//6.1 References
A surprisingly large number of companies want references. 
Line up 2 or 3 people you have worked with

//6.2 Don't worry
It’s easier said than done, but don’t worry about what did or didn’t go well. 
You don’t know what they were looking for, and even if you did there’s no 
point worrying about whether they found it.



//////7. Negotiation
salary negotiation 
http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/


7.2 Don't start negotiating until yes-if not no-but

7.3 Negotiation is not scary
only 1% of negotiation needs to be thinking of a big number and Jedi-mind-tricking 
your way towards it. The other 99% is having several viable options and making 
reasonable statements about their relative attractiveness to you. With strong 
BATNAs (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement), everything becomes much 
simpler.

7.4 Negotiation is not vulgar
People in startups (as well as many other professions) generally like to think 
that they are doing some version of “changing the world for the better.” 
And whilst this is a good and noble-ish thing, it can make you feel 
like a tool when you start talking about and debating salary and equity. 
After all, you should be doing this job for love, not money. Right?

It’s not at all vulgar or unreasonable or disloyal to want to feel fairly 
materially compensated, and any suggestion that there is anything wrong 
with negotiating in good faith with a profit-seeking enterprise is entirely 
disingenuous

Early-stage companies tend to claim poverty and offer salaries at anything 
down to 60% of market rate.

You have to find out the last round valuation of the company, 
the total number of shares issued, and the strike price of your options, 
otherwise an option grant is completely meaningless. It’s not rude to 
be persistent in trying to find this information, 
and it’s not distasteful to ask to be walked through the details 
of the offer until you understand it. Don’t comment on whether 
you are happy with an offer until you are clear what it actually is.


//7.6 Calm down
incredibly important.

That said, it’s easy to be too quick to fly into slightly-hostile-negotiation 
mode once a first offer comes through, without making it clear that you really 
appreciate the company’s interest and offer and really like them and what 
they’re doing, but don’t feel that the deal as it stands fairly reflects 
your value or matches up to your competing offers. It’s good to negotiate, 
but you should still be polite, understanding and open-minded about it.


//Conclusion
It’s a great market to be an engineer, but finding the right job still 
requires a lot of time and effort. Spray applications anywhere and everywhere 
you like the look of, and see what sticks. A little organisation will go a 
long way, but a little over-thinking will quickly make you go insane.

hopefully, with the right combination of luck, skill and more luck, 
you’ll even come out the other side with a job. Good luck!

it starts with you (before strategy)

self-assessment and goal-setting. If you don’t understand yourself, 
you won’t be happy with where you end up. Taking some time to introspect 
can make the process of getting hired a more manageable and strategic process.

Without defining what your own needs are, you will have no way of determining 
the right path forward so hunker down until you’ve got an idea of 
what your key needs are right now (from a job). 

The questions below should help you think about what is actually essential 
for you versus nice-to-have. Ask yourself:
//Needs:
Why do I need a job?
What kind of salary level do I need to sustain myself and my family?
What kind of job security level do I need to sustain myself and my family?
How desperate am I to get a job right now?


//Where You Want To Be:
Once you’ve been honest with yourself about your needs, 
it’s time to figure out what you want. What will your future needs be? 
What kinds of companies do you want to work at?

Why do I want a job in web development?
What kind of career path do I want to have?
Do I want to work in a developer-led organization (vs sales- or business-led)?
Do I prefer working in a team environment or remotely?
Do I like working long hours / weekends or 9-6?
Is the work more important than the people?
Do I have to care about the product I’m building?
Do I have to care about the technologies I’m using?
Do I prefer an “easy” work environment or one where I’m constantly pushed?
Do I want “creature comfort” incentives like free food and beer at the office?
Do I have to enjoy my work or can I power through a crappy job?



//Prioritizing Needs and Wants
You should have at least an informal list of the things that matter to you. 
Now ruthlessly rank them. What are your non-negotiables and what are your 
nice-to-haves? Every company and opportunity will fall somewhere on 
the spectrum defined by those questions and they are the criteria you 
will later use to evaluate them. This will help you stay focused 
when considering opportunities and not spread yourself too thin 
chasing things that you wouldn’t really choose anyway.


Make sure you know every one of your “must-haves” and your top 5 priorities 
for “nice-to-haves” in a job.


//What Are Your Assets and Liabilities?
It’s time to be honest with yourself… what do you bring to the table? 
If you’re early in your career (which you probably are), 
you’ll have to work hard to distinguish yourself from the flood of unqualified 
candidates out there. 
You need to strike the line between being honest with yourself 
and not selling yourself short.

Everyone, especially those just starting out, feels unqualified. 
That’s natural, so don’t worry about it.

This is about figuring out your strengths and weaknesses so you can 
tailor your story to play to your strengths and honestly address your weaknesses.

How hungry am I?
How good am I at building back end code?
How good am I at putting together front ends?
Can I solve really technical problems like brain teasers and algorithms?
Have I built projects that display a good range of skills?
Do I know people who can recommend me?
Am I a good people person who builds relationships easily?
Do I portray an aura of confidence or act shy?
Do I tend to undersell myself and my capabilities?
Do I have a broad level of general tech knowledge?
Am I very familiar with a particular technical or industry vertical? (Usually career switchers have one)
Do I tend to procrastinate or do I just get shit done?
Do I wait to ask for help or do I go out and find the answer on my own?
Do I lean in to challenges or avoid them?
What are some really difficult problems I’ve solved before?


Applying without much experience means you need to fill in your weak 
spots and emphasize your strengths. For almost everyone, your biggest 
strength will be hunger and ability to learn. But companies have heard 
that story before, so you’ll have to tie in other strengths that you 
can to make your story compelling.

there is a difference between hunger for opportunity and desperation. 
Hunger is about seeking reward (which you can do when you’re in a comfortable 
situation and optimizing opportunities) and desperation is about avoiding 
failure (which occurs when you absolutely MUST have that job). 
Do whatever it takes to not sound desperate, even if you are.

What Companies you want

You have to think about things from the perspective of the company. 
Why are they interested in hiring you? What, therefore, will they look for?

Hiring managers are busy people. That’s why they need someone new… to remove some 
of their workload and get their team working better or faster. 
They also have to deal with potentially hundreds of unqualified applicants 
every week, which takes up too much of their valuable time. 
They just want to get back to building stuff and not have to hire again 
anytime soon. So they are looking for someone who can add value as soon 
as possible and who will be able to grow with the organization.

So to summarize, hiring managers are usually looking for 3 main things:

Capability
Motivation
Fit

The first part, adding value immediately, is more difficult – 
that’s where they want to see that you’ve had relevant experience 
before and can meet their technical bar. There’s a bit of a catch-22 
with getting hired – the easiest way to show you are employable 
is to have been employed before. It’s a check mark next to you. 
So to cater to this; do whatever you can to show that other 
people have believed in you enough to use your work and skills.


The second characteristic, growth, is something you shouldn’t have much 
trouble selling if you’ve come this far and learned web development on your own. 
The key is to present yourself as a growth curve, not just a static line 
(i.e. you’ll continue learning and improving very rapidly and not stop). 
You have real career goals and you’ve learned incredibly fast so far to 
get to where you are (right?).


Aside from those two characteristics, there is another major factor – fit. 
The hiring manager wants someone they and their team can work well with.

you often make or break your chances by being someone the team members 
want to know better and work with all day long. Almost all hiring processes 
ask the full team to evaluate a late-stage candidate.



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

software development is 95 percent design and 5 percent construction
Software developers are not engineers.


can learn a new skill, e.g., a new programming language, in a matter of a few days. 
This is because they have a natural ability to think in design terms 
and they can easily use whatever tools are available.

During the interview process the person doing the interview should “talk” 
to the candidate. Ask them about what they like, what they have done, 
what things excite them, etc. However, be sure that the people undertaking 
the interviews are in fact talented interviewers. 
They’ll recognize quickly if this is the “right” person or not.

I am one of the key interviewers for my company, usually giving 
5 - 10 interviews / week, ranging in candidates like test engineers, 
software engineers, software architects, project managers, program managers, 
and product managers. While a typical interview with me lasts for 45 minutes, 
I probably have 2 - 3 hours worth of interview material.

Senior people are always easy to hire; as they know their area of expertise

So how do you sort out the candidates with potential from the ones who 
are just repeating what they memorized in the latest programming book they read. 
The basic knowledge is usually the same. The candidates most all be competent 
in your technology of choice, they must get along with your team, and they 
must fit your budget range. Now the hard part, once you've identified a 
few candidates that fit these basic criteria, how do you know who will 
really succeed? Who will improve your team? Who will exceed your expectations?


Evaluate Problem Solving. Try and find out how the candidate works through a 
problem that they don't know the answer. How do you weigh a 747? Why are 
manhole covers round? How many cars are there in New York City? Questions 
like this are not designed to reach the answer, but to see how the candidate 
thinks. How do they respond to help? Do they ask questions? Do they break 
down the question logically or randomly? These are some key indicators for 
imaging the candidate 6 months down the road when you have to develop a 
solution that no one on the team has ever seen before. Maybe an obscure 
defect that you can't reproduce These situations will inevitably come up, 
and you want your team best prepared to handle the unknown, and be able to 
breakdown a problem logically.

Hire Smart People
Admitting Ignorance. Throw out some questions that the candidate has no way 
to answer. Don't throw out a brain teaser for this one, but throw out something 
extremely technical or deep, or on a technology just outside of their knowledge 
level.
Anyone who can admit they don't know something when they are engaged 
in an interview is someone with the maturity you are looking for. 
Professional maturity is a great indicator for future success, 
knowledge transfer, and constant growth.

Communication Counts. 
Try to get the candidate to explain something complex to you. 
Did you understand it? Was the information presently structurally or randomly? 
How long did he consider his answer? Was he comfortable launching into a diatribe? 
At the end of the day, communication is key for any team,
As long as someone can clearly express their status, position, opinion, thoughts, 
really anything, then your chances for team success have just gone up exponentially.


Career Goals are Good
You want to make sure that your candidate has some goals, 
and he's on the path to reach them. The actual goals aren't very important, 
it is that there is a career plan being executed. It shows forethought, 
direction, and purpose.

and all you are trying to do as the hiring manager is to hire the candidate 
with the highest likelihood of succeeding.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The corollary of that rule—the rule that the great people are never on 
the market—is that the bad people—the seriously unqualified—are on the market 
quite a lot. They get fired all the time, because they can’t do their job. 
and they ruin the company

competent people. They’re on the market more than the great people, 
but less than the incompetent, and all in all they will show up in small 
numbers in your 1000 resume pile

have to be able to figure out who the right programmers are

The in-person interview is just one part of the hiring process, 
which starts with sorting resumes and a phone screen.

if you spend less than one hour on an interview you’re not going to be able to make a decision.

You’re looking for people who are
Smart, and (thoughtful)
Get things done.(practical)

How do you detect smart in an interview? The first good sign is that 
you don’t have to explain things over and over again. The conversation just flows.

Who cares what the difference is? You can find out online in about fifteen 
seconds! Remember, smart does not mean “knows the answer to trivia questions.”

Anyway, software teams want to hire people with aptitude, 
not a particular skill set. Any skill set that people can bring 
to the job will be technologically obsolete in a couple of years, anyway, 
so it’s better to hire people that are going to be able to learn any new 
technology rather than people who happen to know how to make JDBC talk 
to a MySQL database right this minute.

But in general, the way to learn the most about a person is to let them 
do the talking. Give them open-ended questions and problems.

There are actually hundreds of famous Microsoft interview questions. 
Everybody has a set of questions that they really like.

Here’s a typical plan for interviewing a programmer:

Introduction
Question about recent project candidate worked on
Easy Programming Question
Pointer/Recursion Question
Are you satisfied?
Do you have any questions?

don’t ask around about the person before you interview them

we are interested in how they go about solving problems, not the actual answer.

One: Look for passion. Smart people are passionate about the projects they work on. 
They get very excited talking about the subject. They talk quickly, 
and get animated. Being passionately negative can be just as good a sign. 

Two: Good candidates are careful to explain things well, at whatever level.
in terms that a normal person could understand. 

A good answer to this might be “I got together with the other members of 
the team and wrote a proposal…” 

Most of the time in the interview, though, should be spent letting the candidate 
prove that they can write code.

Reassure candidates that you understand that it’s hard to write code without 
an editor, and you will forgive them if the whiteboard gets really messy. 
Also you understand that it’s hard to write bug-free code without a compiler, 
and you will take that into account.

Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z
Write a function that determines the area of a circle given the radius
Add up all the values in an array

everybody solved the problem, but there was a lot of variation in how long it took them to solve.

And the same thing happens in programming. If the basic concepts aren’t so 
easy that you don’t even have to think about them, you’re not going to get 
the big concepts.

Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some 
people just can’t do

recursion and functional programming in one class and C or Pascal with 
data structures in another class

When was the last time you had to write a sorting algorithm?

I want programmers to know programming down to the CPU level

Even though the format of the interview is, superficially, just a 
candidate writing some code on the whiteboard, my real goal here 
is to have a conversation about it. “Why did you do it that way?” 
“What are the performance characteristics of your algorithm?” 
“What did you forget?” “Where’s your bug?”

Notice that the kinds of hints I’m happy to provide are really just answers 
to trivia questions—the kinds of things that you find on Google.

All programmers make mistakes, there’s nothing wrong with that, 
they just have to be able to find them.

the good candidates have lots of choices about where to work and they’re 
using this day to figure out if they want to work for you.

It’s against the law to talk based on national origin, personal life.
Basically, stick to questions which are completely relevant to the job 
for which they are interviewing.

Show vs tell
Putting java on your resume and showing employers that you can develop 
in java incorporating object oriented principles is much more effective.

showing your java and OO abilities and including how you continue to 
improve and grow in this area by taking classes and joining meetups and 
forums is a recruiter’s dream come true

Collaborative coding
Why should you love a collaborative code management site like Github?  
If your account is public, potential employers can see your activity.  
Are you contributing to projects?  Are you building your own projects?

Open communication and collaboration is important to employers and to communities.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////






Internships
A good way to start getting experience and show others that you’re employable 
is to get an internship. Just make sure it’s a paid internship because no one 
values things they get for free. You want the people you work with to value 
your contributions and feel like they have a stake in helping you succeed. 
The good part is that internships tend to focus more on your growth potential 
than what you’ve done before


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
How do I get a software internship?

You contribute to open-source projects. Your github account is your portfolio, 
and if you don't have one, fix that.

I've worked at a convenience store...

"Showed up on-time, was courteous and professional with colleagues and customers, 
was able to learn to do the job and was trustworthy enough to manage the cash 
and close up by themselves", those are not nothing.

Yes. It's kind of understood that you don't know much but are teachable at 
that level.

Shows up on time, is courteous and professional with customers and colleagues, 
is able to learn to do the job and is trustworthy enough to handle important 
responsibilities themselves.

What dose expect interns to do? Fix bugs, implement small features. 
They do real work, but not the hardest of the work. Often, things full 
time employees would find boring (this doesn't work in Internet explorer...)

Don't psych yourself out. Software engineering is one of the few markets 
that still has a reasonable amount of demand in this economy. 
Plus, you're doing this work for next to free. You do not have to grovel 
for an internship, especially if you've been motivated enough to 
come up with your own projects outside of your coursework.

Depends on the employer. At my (tiny) company, our intern doesn't have a 
CS degree but is expected to assist on research that is designed to 
improve the quality of our data. Interns at the larger company 
I used to work at contributed significant code that led to their eventual 
integration in the company.


Employers do not expect you to know everything, or really even anything. 
They expect you to be able to learn quickly and to be able to find the resources you need to accomplish your goals.
They expect you to ask questions. 
They expect you to understand that you know next to nothing about the code base and product. 
They expect you to be relatively easy to get along with and to show up on time.


employers look for enthusiasm, personality fit, and problem solving ability. 
Remember that problem solving ability includes the ability to ask questions, 
ask for help, and communicate effectively. 

At a bare minimum, your cover letter should indicate that you've thought about 
the position and why your skillset/interests would be a good fit for the company. 
You don't need to mention your work at a convenience store unless you're 
applying for a customer facing position.

look professional and tidy. If they like you, it doesn't really matter what 
you wear. If they don't like you, your clothes are probably about last on the 
reasons they don't want to hire you.


ct like your projects matter. Demonstrate that you have some passion 
for what you are doing
a lot of my classmates have been far less successful in getting responses 
or call backs, but they flat-out admit they’re in it for money and it shows.

You can gain practical experience at any job. Communication skills, 
strong work ethic, examples of teamwork, and examples of problem-solving 
are good things to mention on your resume.

Try and talk to recruiters and be enthusiastic.
Be aggressive, but not annoying.

You want to show that you're bright and learn new stuff fast. 
List your projects. List relevant coursework. If you've got nontrivial 
code to point to (on github, for example), do that.

I help my interns pick a project where a) they will design, write, review, 
and test code with other engineers on a team, b) they will learn new things, 
and c) they will launch before they leave

Being in it for the experience is a great attitude, 
but you want to intern at a good company. At good companies CS interns are paid.

I only care about whether you can code and whether 
you can listen and follow directions.

I'm not talking about things that took thousands of lines of code, but things 
that took advantage of existing libraries, or are little programs that show 
some creative thinking.
FWIW, I now work as a software engineer at a Fortune 500 company. And yes, the first internship was invaluable.

There are a few reasons employers hire software development interns:
* Cheap labor: 
* Talent Scouting/Development

The single most important thing you can do is to have a project on GitHub, 
or to contribute to an open source project. I can't emphasize this enough. 
If you have code on the web, I WILL pull it down and look at it. 
So make sure that your code is well formatted and commented (and works!).

What you can do to prepare

Taking a structured approach to getting hired means starting early 
and getting some important things out of the way first.

Get Good!
address your weak points (even if it’s the tricky stuff like algorithms 
and data structures) in order to be qualified for the kinds of positions 
you’re applying to.

It really means crafting a story about who you are, 
how you got to where you are, 
and why you’ll keep growing.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

////Build a Portfolio
Employers want to see that you can build and ship code and that you 
make good decisions when confronted with engineering trade-offs. 
All of this stems from conversations about your portfolio of work.

The portfolio is also important for another thing that isn’t mentioned 
much – social proof. If you’ve been a part of larger or group projects, 
that’s almost like showing that you’ve worked somewhere before. It makes 
the employer comfortable that other people have worked with you before so 
they can too.

Your portfolio as a developer is GitHub.

Portfolio
Take the time you need to produce something that will impress them--it'll 
really pay off.

As a fellow developer, I can appreciate the beauty of a well-designed console 
application, or a clever applet with hardly any interface at all. 
If you've written code you're particularly proud of, show me that.

more important is that you are excited about what you worked on.

If you took the time to highlight the cool stuff and bring it with you, 
that already puts you far ahead

After narrowing down the project list, include relevant details for each project. 
Basic details that should always be included are the project name, your role in 
the development cycle, a description of what the code does, a high-level 
description of how it works, and the skills, programming language, 
and technology stack used.

write about any challenges that were overcome during the course of development.

have a section of your resume with clickable links to your portfolio and 
anything else that is relevant (GitHub, Bitbucket, Programming Blog, 
Stack Overflow, etc.).


Software Engineers Are In Demand, And GitHub Is How You Find Them

I know of a dozen startup founders who regularly spend time on GitHub, 
looking for engineers and programmers they can add to their team

People grow their reputation through the number of "commits" 
(updates to code that they authorize) and "forks" 
(copies of existing projects that they take in an alternate direction) 
in their "repos" (code repositories).

A commit to GitHub matters lot more to us than the resume.”

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Clean up your Web Presence (and Have One)

Google yourself in an incognito window (to avoid Google’s smart algorithm). 
What comes up? Do the links fit into your personal narrative? 
Whoever is looking to hire you will certainly Google you.

Make sure that what they find matches what you want them to find.

If you’ve got a ridiculously common name, you may have a harder time building 
your web presence but it’s also harder to have the wrong web presence.

The most important part of your web presence to fix up is your GitHub profile. 
Make sure your projects are organized and their README files contain a description 
and a link to where it is live so anyone looking at the project can quickly 
see your brilliance.

Next, try to be discoverable. If we’re trying to get in touch with you or 
find your work on the web, can I? Do you have a personal website? 
Are you on Twitter? You don’t need to go crazy with social media, 
but sometimes just having enough of a profile to be a “real” person 
and give people the opportunity to get in touch with you can go a long way.

LinkedIn is fast replacing the resume.

Own you Domain
with your own name

The good news here is that you can use the blog to promote yourself 
(or your business) and control what shows up on Google at the same time. 
A warning, though: While blogs are cheap and relatively easy to set up, 
don’t start one unless you have the discipline and writing skills to maintain it.

An untended blog grows the equivalent of “digital weeds” that will 
undermine the positive impression you’re trying to make. 

However, if you do decide to launch a blog, the Google-owned Blogger.com 
blogging platform ranks crazy-high in searches. Coincidence? Another option 
is Wordpress, where you can incorporate your name into your blog URL, 
which can also improve your search rank. Remember it’s always best 
to have your own domain.


you should own your name on all of the top social networks.

Find a reporter to write about your volunteer project, write an article for 
a business journal or guest post on a popular blog you follow. 
The trick here is to keep it going so you can (hopefully) bury whatever 
it is you don’t want people to locate under an avalanche of things you do. 
Also, your comments on high-profile sites can show up in results as well, 
so use them as an opportunity for others to see you at your very best

ability to pass a background check than anything else;


having an online presence is different from having a presence that shows 
you are active in your programming community. Blogging, answering questions 
on forums or Stack Exchange sites, participating in open source (or starting 
such) projects, writing articles etc show that. All of these are bonuses as 
far as good employers are concerned.

None of the above are requirements for getting a job, but they are all 
good to have in order to increase your chances. In other words, given 
two candidates that score similarly on the points the employer cares about, 
if one shows participation in the community and the other doesn't, 
the one that does will have a better chance at getting the offer.

They will search the applicants that passed the first stage online, 
on Google and other social sites. They will check blogs, github, bitbucket, 
SE like sites, mailing lists, forums etc. to get to know you a little bit more, 
to see if you worth an interview.

Now, if you have a strong resume (work experience in related areas, 
good references etc.), the online search part may not matter much.

I’d like to give more techniques on how to build out your 
professional image by showcasing your skills and experience online.


resources give validity, credibility, and interactivity to your brand 

GitHub your way to glory
GitHub is a crown jewel for developers. Be sure to show off your most 
elegant code and highlight any projects you’ve worked on. Tidy up your READMEs, 
choose descriptive variable names, and use a consistent coding style.

Recruiters will use GitHub to investigate the projects you’ve worked on and 
check out your code. In this way, the more information you can provide about 
your software engineering skills, the more compelling a candidate you are.

Make sure your social media profiles show that you’re an intelligent, 
well-meaning thinker and team player. Your online behavior should always 
align with your personal brand. Make sure there’s nothing on your profiles 
that could botch your professional image.

Highlight your social media profiles in your applications if you use them 
to voice ideas about your industry, share new content, or engage with your 
professional network.

Show pride in your work, interest in your next career move, 
and a hunger for breakout ideas.

Get Out in the Community and Collect Information
Find and meet other developers.
genuine human connection
for now, it’s probably just for answering questions and harvesting advice but your
next job will probably be found through the people you know and 
some who you meet while you’re gathering this advice. 

People like giving advice and like investing themselves emotionally 
in other people with growth curves.

what exactly different jobs are and what they’re looking for. 
The easiest way to find out is ask developers what they do.

Set a goal of talking to 5 real human beings about your job search.

Another way to get this information is to check out a whole bunch of job postings.

don’t be afraid to produce content like blogging or answering questions on Quora. 
They don’t need to be explicitly technical, but should showcase your ability 
to think critically and write well. Both of these play well with future employers.

it’s best to keep your site simple, clean and to the point 
rather than bloated and full of “look what I can do!” features. 
Let your portfolio of work speak for itself.


56% of all hiring managers are more impressed by a candidate’s personal 
website than any other personal branding tool

only 7% of job seekers actually have a personal website.


One, it gives hiring managers a glimpse into your personality, 
he says. “A website gives you creative freedom to express your personality 
in ways that are not be possible through your resume.

Everything from the bio paragraph you write to the design options you choose 
for your website says something about you, and gives recruiters more chances 
to decide

your own website allows you to control what people will find when 
they search for you.

“Keep information interesting, but relatively neutral,”

“Avoid providing information that might be controversial such as religious 
or political views. Always keep the word ‘relevance’ in mind. Ask yourself: 
Is this relevant to the employer and to the position?”


Here’s what your website should have:
//A Focus
why this website ?
what is the purpose 
who will read it ?
what skills and information you want to highlight ?

//contact information
in header and footer in every page

Leave off your home address and keep contact information more general--such 
as your name, e-mail and phone number,” 


//A brief bio. 
An “About Me” page can be helpful to hiring managers—but be sure to keep 
it professional and brief.

you can provide any additional information that may not be on your 
resume or cover letter, such as interests, hobbies, or awards and 
accomplishments.

Pooley says if you want to include a professional photo, 
this is a good place to display it. “It should be a high-quality, 
preferably professionally-taken, headshot or wide shot. 
Avoid the temptation to use a smartphone photo, especially if you took 
it yourself.”


//Your resume. 
You should always include your resume, Brooks says. 
“Keep in mind that a potential employer may only be provided with 
your website URL,” Kahn adds. “Make sure they have access your 
resume on the website so they can get a fulsome picture of your 
qualifications.”

//Professional summary/objective.
short, descriptive bio helps explain to visitors what you do and how you 
can help them,”
And it will encourage visitors to keep reading.

//Samples of your work.
