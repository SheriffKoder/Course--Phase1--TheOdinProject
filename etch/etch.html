HTML : layoyt, structure, fundamental building block
Hyper Markup Language

CSS: style, screen size responsive, look and feel
Cascading Style sheet
BootStrap


JS: interactivity

Python
Ruby; allows making everything to build a website with on Rails framework
PHP: 
SQL: Maintain and optimize large databases


API, Application Programming Interface, 
agreement between client requests and server sharing data

The DOM tree, Document Object Model API (DOM), 
getElementById()
tree of nodes, 

Node.js allows JS to work on server side

~ let x = Number ();


<head>   <base href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
Specify a default URL and a default target for all links on a page:
<body> <a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base Tag</a>

web servers will by default look for an index.html page
doctypeâ€™s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use
lang="en" used for improving accessibility of the webpage

in VSCode, !+enter brings a boiler plate

 HTML character encoding is called ASCII
UTF-8, supports many languages, compatible with ASCII, used by XML, less space

lang, lang-subtag, lang-country_code,
ru-Cyrl-BY

header levels provide a hierarchy to the content


<strong> useful for voice accessibility importance feature
<b> without importance
    

/* LISTS --------------------------------------------------------------*/

with the <ol> element, the order is meaningful.
list-style-type" circle/disc/square/triangle/ '-'/decimal/upper-roman
list-style-type: "\1F44D"; // thumbs up sign

ol global attributes: reversed, start='1', type='a/A/i/I/1(one)'
li value='9'
solid dot. This solid dot is called the list item marker, and it can be changed using CSS.

<dl> description list
    <dt> description term element 
        <dd> description element

shows as >>
    element
            text for element


nesting
    <li>
        <ul> <li>'s'..
markers will change according to how deeply the list is nested.
The <li> element may contain any normal element as desired

<nav> is a block element like div,

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------*/


/* LINKS --------------------------------------------------------------*/

protocol://domain/path  absolute
./folder/page.html relative

../ (stepping a step back in directories)

The alt attribute is used to describe an image. 
It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.

in prev versions img used to be closed with /> but with HTML5 just use >

%20 = space in links so better use _

<a href='/'>home page</a>
Root-relative link, server related

Link attributes
download: treat the linked url as a download
href, can use tel:, mailto:, 
ping
refer
rel
target, _self(current context), _blank(new tab), _parent(parent of current context), _top(highest context that's an ancestor of the current one)
charset
type
coords
href lang
shape
rev
name

The content inside a link should indicate where the link goes, even out of context.


Images
jpg is not transparent
png transparency
svg vector based graphics format, scale without loss of quality

defining height or width, one will make the other adjust
width='75' unless you want to stretch can use both

        &lt; &gt; and &amp;. //< > &
        &ldquo; &rdquo; &lsquo; &rsquo; " " ' '

        UTF-8 character set, any character directly into the HTML document
        <meta charset='UTF-8'/>


Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. 
This will create a timeline of your progress

commit messages should be concise and clear
commit message shows whether a developer is a good collaborator.
what information the message should/should not contain
style: Markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation, simplicity

> 50 chars first line as a(subject line) summarizing the change
> capitalize the subject line first letter, no period
blank like
> around 72 characters body
>Result

take a look at changes:
git show, git diff, git log -p

prints out just the subject line:
git log --oneline, git shortlog


> Make context of header, blank line, Body in outside note and copy it

Shortcuts:
Q to quit, 
Z to end of log

> use imperative mood in the subject line, like Clean your room, Close the door
If applied, this commit will (your subject line here)

Extra 


<em> and <strong> are used by the html markup to define the type of content
and can be changed, but <i> <b> are used for presentation purposes like css

avoid using <br/> <hr/> beside each other much as they convey meaning, instead use css for that task
self closing elements

The trailing slash (/) in all empty HTML elements is entirely optional.
like br and hr


// Semantic HTML, idea all HTML markup //
convey the underlying meaning of content not appearance
