Semantic HTML


div and span
they’re not always the most a11y friendly elements to use.
you should check
.there is a more appropriate element to use in certain situations
.you’re using an element correctly.


Some elements have a semantic meaning, but don’t really provide any context 
when announced by assistive technologies like <p>

there are elements that have a semantic meaning and are announced with some 
sort of context to help users perceive or operate them, like a <button>.

<div> <span> no semantic meaning, not provide context
They still have their uses as generic containers, such as for layouts or 
for generic text.


semantics:
<button> instead of div containers
<table>, lists, appropriate list element (<ol>, <ul>, or <dl>)
<label> for input fields, input field with the right type attr

//Okay, these are *definitely* buttons better than divs to convey clickable images
<div class='button-container'>
    <button class='rock'>Rock</button>
    <button class='paper'>Paper</button>
    <button class='scissors'>Scissors</button>
</div>
  
  
//Label method 1
<label for='name'>Name</label>
<input type='text' id='name' />

//Label method 2
<label>
Name
<input type='text' />
</label>

here are seven native HTML elements that define these landmark regions:
ot only can screen reader users navigate a page via landmarks and headings 
by using navigation keyboard commands (or opening a menu in their screen reader), 
but these elements also have their roles announced to provide additional context.

<aside>
<footer>
<form>
<header>
<main>
<nav>
<section>


make cells focusable if its used in interaction only

table is created using the appropriate HTML elements (or ARIA roles) 
screen readers can inform users about the characteristics of the table, 
and users have access to keyboard commands specifically for navigating 
tabular content.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
NVDA, Jaws
uses keyboard commands, 80% of the screen reader market
there is a difference between keyboard and screen reader navigation.


<table>
    <caption>Average daily tea and coffee consumption</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Person</th><th>Coffee</th><th>Tea</th>
    </tr>

Press t to move screen reader focus to the table and NVDA will say:
Average daily tea and coffee consumption
Table with 3 columns and 4 rows
Average daily tea and coffee consumption caption


These four keyboard commands let you move left/right through rows 
and up/down through columns, and with them you have the basic method 
of navigating data tables with NVDA (and Jaws).

.down arrow
.control alt + right/left/up/down


//alt+ down then use control alt + right arrow and NVDA will tell you:
Coffee
Column 2
5 cups


the screen reader uses the information it got from the browser to create 
an association between information and headers

some people navigate with headings which gives order
use heading level in order from h1>h6

Meaningful text

when a user reads text or has it announced to them
they should be able to immediately understand what it means 
even without any surrounding context

provide meaningful text to users
helps especially those who rely on assistive technologies


////Links
make sure that the text content of the <a> element
somehow indicates where the link redirects to and that it's brief
around 100 characters, 
so avoid using phrases like "click here" or "this page"

if a link will open or download a file
include text that tells the user what kind of file it is and the file size

also indicate if target="_blank" and will open in a new tab

<a href='...'>2021 Sign Up Statistics (PDF, 1MB)</a>
<a href='...'>GitHub (opens in new tab)</a>


////Forms

<div class='input-error'>
  Error: Email is invalid.
</div>
an example that clearly tells you what input is invalid, 
so you now know exactly where to go. While this might be all a user needs to know, 
it’s worth keeping in mind that it is still a rather vague error. 
yet We don’t know why our email is invalid.

<div class='input-error'>
  Error: 'JohnSmith@@test.com' is not valid. Example of a valid email: example@yourdomain.com.
</div>

more meaningful. It not only tells you what input is invalid, 
but also how to fix the error.

Generally when you inform a user of a form error, you should be informing 
them what input caused the error and, when possible, 
how to fix the error or why the error occurred in some way.


placed at the top of the form (“* indicates a required field”)
placed alongside the input or its label (“Name (required)”).
password input lists any characters that the password must contain 
    (“Must include at least one uppercase letter and one number…”)




////Alternative Text

<img src='...' alt='' />
if the image does not convey meaning and not want assistive technologies to be aware of it

If you simply omitted the alt attribute, the presence of the image could 
still be announced, which may confuse the user (especially if the file name 
was a random string of letters and numbers).

Alternative text is a textual substitute for non-text content in web pages. like images

. Screen readers announce alternative text in place of images,
. If an image fails to load or the user has blocked images, 
  the browser will present the alternative text visually in place of the image.
. Search engines use alternative text and factor it into their assessment 
  of the page purpose and content.


Alternative text 
can be the alt attr
or within visible body text near the image
wether on a separate page, linked from either the image or a text link
adjacent to the image

Every image should have an alt attribute, even if it's alt="" 
(sometimes called "null" alternative text).

First, consider its content and function. An image only has a function 
if it is linked (or has an <area> within a <map>), or if it's in a <button> . 
In this case, the image does not have a function.

If the image's content is presented within the surrounding text, 
then alt="" may be all that's needed.

the alt attr should:
. be accurate
. concise 
. not be redundant or provide the same information as text near the image.
. not include phrases like "image of ..." or "graphic of ...", etc. 
This would be redundant since screen readers already announce "graphic" 
along with the alt text. If the fact that an image is a photograph or illustration, 
etc. is important content, it may be useful to include this in alternative text.


//Functional images
Images are often used not only to provide content, 
but to provide important functions, such as navigation.

surrounding text Ellen Ochoa, Astronaut
So, alt="Astronaut Ellen Ochoa" is the best choice. A screen reader would typically 
read "Link, Image, Astronaut Ellen Ochoa. Ellen Ochoa, Astronaut".

The redundancy is necessary to adequately describe the function of the linked image, 
especially if it were to be accessed in isolation from the adjacent text, 
such as if a screen reader user were navigating by links.

"Wikipedia entry for Ellen Ochoa, Astronaut" provides content other than 
that conveyed by the image—the fact the link goes to Wikipedia.

"Read More" does not provide enough information, especially out of context.

Now, both the content and function of the linked image are presented as 
text within the link, so the image would have alt="" to avoid redundancy.
A screen reader would typically read, "Link, Ellen Ochoa, Astronaut"—much 
more efficient than above.

When possible, avoid using "link to...", "click here for...", etc. 
in the alt attribute. Screen readers already announce links as links.


Download the employment application <image with attr="PDF">
pdf is already sufficient here



//Decorative Images, use alt=""
does not present important content,
is used for layout or non-informative purposes, and
does not have a function (e.g., is not a link).


Note
When an image is used only for decorative purposes, it is best to remove 
the image from the page content and instead define it as a CSS background image. 
This will remove the need for alternative text entirely, and will remove the 
image from the semantic and structural flow of the page.

<a href="application.pdf">Download the Employment Application<span class="pdficon"> (PDF)</span></a>

/Because the image does not convey relevant or important content, 
empty alt text is best here.

Consider: If the image were deleted, would important content be lost?
"if I could not use this image, what would I put in its place?"


//Advanced Images

/Form image buttons
if an image is used as a button
the image needs an alt attribute that describes the function of the button. 
The alt text should describe what the button will do when activated, 
such as "Search", "Submit", "Register", "Place your order", etc.

//Logos
hearing "Link, Graphic, Acme Company" at the top of a web page is sufficient 
for a screen reader user to know that it is a logo linked to the home page.
so use alt=""


if alt description wont fit
detailed alternative text can be provided adjacent on the same page
or on a separate web page, linked from the page with the image. 
The link can be adjacent to the image, or the image itself could be linked 
to the description page.

"Painting of George Washington crossing the Delaware River"
for example and provide more info elsewhere

There is no one right answer here. The best alternative text will depend 
on the context and intended content of the image.


//Figure and figcaption
The <figure> element, designed to contain an <img> and a <figcaption>, 
is self-contained and typically referenced as a single unit from the main 
flow of the document. A <figure> can be separated from the main flow of 
the document without affecting the document's meaning.
However, the <img> still needs alt text—and to prevent redundancy, 
this information should not be conveyed via the <figcaption> 


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

“click here” links can be activated by the keyboard, but it implies that you 
need a mouse to activate the link.

Rule 1 : Don’t use the word “link” in your links

Rule 2: Don’t capitalize links
some screen readers read capitalized text letter-by-letter.
and its difficult to read

Rule 3: Avoid ASCII characters, ASCII art, emoticons, and leetspeak,

However if you absolutely must use emoticons, then at least mark them up 
with some ARIA:

<span class="sr-only">Smiley face</span>
<span aria-hidden="true">:-)</span>


Rule 4: Avoid using URLs as link text
a screen reader is going to read the URL letter-by-letter.

Rule 5: Keep link text concise

Rule 6: Restrict the number of text links on a page
If there are a lot of links on a page, it makes it that much harder 
to navigate a site.


Rule 7: Don’t link directly to downloads
never embed critical information in CSS.

can include in a table of title, file-type1, file-type2

  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  border: 0;
}

Rule 9: Be aware of pagination and alphabetized links
Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, 
indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element“.

Rule 10: Be mindful when using anchor links

Rule 11: The case for underlining links
you should never underline text in the online world unless you are 
representing a link
use a contrast ratio of 3:1 on link focus

Rule 12: Design with keyboard-only users in mind
the item with the keyboard focus is a different color to the surrounding content 
and outlined with a dotted border.

if content changes on mouse hover, the same should occur on keyboard focus.


//Scripted links

Using scripting events, via JavaScript, to emulate links is also banned under 
the WCAG2.

All links should be created using A HREF or AREA. The use of ONCLICK on random 
elements, such as SPAN, IMG and DIV is not permitted.


Rule 13: Be mindful when using images as links

Rule 14: Eliminate broken or empty links
I can only guess that they are inserted by some Content Management Systems glitch.
All they’ll hear is “link end link” and find themselves wondering if they 
are missing something — or perhaps they’ll assume the link is an image with 
an empty ALT attribute.


Rule 15: Make your links consistent
Consistency is your friend. It lets your users orient themselves quickly.

Usable and Accessible Form Validation and Error Recovery

Form validation ensures that web forms are filled out with all necessary 
information in the correct format.

server-side—the form information is submitted and analyzed by the web server, and necessary feedback messages are written to a newly generated web page
client-side—form validation and error recovery are performed within the web client or browser using JavaScript and generated within the web page.
Advantages of server-side validation and error recovery include:

The form can be completed and submitted without interruption from validation alerts, errors, or warnings.
The user does not need to have scripting enabled in their browser.
Validation mechanisms are more difficult to bypass or modify, making it more secure.
Advantages of client-side validation and error recovery:

Validation can occur in real time, before the user submits the form data to the server.
Functionality does not require server-side scripting.
Some users may disable scripting in their browser. As such, developers should not require client-side scripting in order for the web form to be accurately completed and submitted. Additionally, any client-side validation or information can easily be modified or disabled within the browser. For best results, developers can utilize both server-side and client-side validation and error recovery to provide both efficiency and security.

Building Usable Forms
Creating a user-friendly and accessible form is an important first step to ensure that a user completes the form correctly. This can be accomplished by:

providing all necessary instructions and cues.
associating form controls with a text label by using the label element.
implementing fieldset and legend elements to associate groups of checkboxes and radio buttons.
ensuring that the reading and navigation order is logical.
ensuring that the form can be completed and submitted using a keyboard.
testing that the form controls, labels, and functionality are understandable and usable.

validation and submission process must be available when using both the mouse and keyboard.


Error Recovery
If either client-side or server-side validation detects errors in the form, then there is a 3-step process to ensure usable and accessible error recovery:

Alert the user to the presence of the error in an apparent and accessible manner.
Allow the user to easily access the form controls that need to be modified.
Allow resubmission and revalidation of the form.

with three primary approaches:
Error alert, then focus
all errors on top of form
Inline errors

A combination of "Errors on top" and "Inline errors" techniques can often be optimal


aria-invalid
Regardless of the mechanism used to identify and recover from form errors, 
aria-invalid="true" should generally be set on each invalid form control. 
This attribute causes screen readers to identify the control as being "invalid" 
or in need of attention.


general principles should be applied:

Build forms that are easy to use and intuitive, providing all necessary instructions, cues, and prompts.
Ensure the forms are keyboard accessible.
Associate form <label> elements with form controls.
Use fieldsets and legends to associate groups of checkboxes and radio buttons.
Include necessary instructions within form <label> elements (e.g., required or specially formatted controls)
Do not rely on JavaScript alone for form submission, validation, and error recovery.
Alert the user of any validation errors in an apparent and accessible manner with informative feedback messages.
Allow the user to easily access the form controls that need to be modified.
Allow resubmission and revalidation of the form information.

WAI-ARIA


WAI-ARIA introduces attributes that can help make websites even more 
accessible by modifying the semantics and context of elements

ARIA) is to define a way to make web content more accessible when native HTML is unable to do so. 


ARIA can’t:
modify an element’s appearance,
modify an element’s behavior,
add focusability, or
add keyboard event handling.

When you use ARIA, you will usually have to take additional steps to add in 
any missing semantics or functionality.

ARIA can be extremely powerful when used correctly, but it can be equally as 
dangerous when used incorrectly.

Five rules of Aria:
Always use native HTML elements and attributes over ARIA when possible.
Never change native semantics, unless you have no other choice.
All interactive ARIA controls must be usable with a keyboard.
Never use role='presentation' or aria-hidden='true' on focusable elements.
All interactive elements must have an accessible name.


The accessibility tree is based on the DOM
the accessibility tree contains only the accessibility related information 
that will be used by assistive technologies. The way ARIA works is by modifying 
properties of the objects that make up this accessibility tree
