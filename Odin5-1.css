Introduction To Web Accessibility
a11y friendly concepts
important to keep in mind when developing a website.

When you develop a website, you’re developing it for users, and you need 
that website to actually be usable by them.

depending on the country, there could actually be laws requiring accessibility 
to be implemented.


Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed 
and developed so that people with disabilities and other circumstantial 
limitations can use them with as few barriers as possible.

-visual/hearing problems = audio/captions, text size/audio adjustments, signs
-arm usage circumstances
-using a phone outside on a bright day or noisy place
-slow bandwidth
-not tech savy/computer skills
-older people
-use duration
-ADHD, understanding complex concepts, anxiety, memory,
-migraines, reaction to visual flickering or audio signals at certain frequencies or pattenrs
-un ability to use parts of body to pain etc.
-bright color sensitivity, color blindness, 
-vision, partial sight, not sharp, tunnel vision, only edge seeing, clouded vision


Depending on the individual needs, people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities often rely on:

Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and orientation;
Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts;
Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction;
Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and search;
Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise distracting content;
Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations;

Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use.
Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand.
Long passages of text without images, graphs, or other illustrations to highlight the context.
Moving, blinking, or flickering content, and background audio that cannot be turned off.
Web browsers and media players that do not provide mechanisms to suppress animations and audio.
Visual page designs that cannot be adapted using web browser controls or custom style sheets.

People with physical disabilities rely on keyboard support to activate functionality 
provided on web pages. They may need more time to type, click, or carry out other 
interaction, and they may type single keystrokes in sequence rather than typing 
simultaneous keystrokes

Providing large clickable areas, enough time to complete tasks, 
and error correction options for forms are important design aspects. 

visible indicators of the current focus, and mechanisms to skip over blocks, 
such as over page headers or navigation bars. 

Images, controls, and other structural elements that do not have equivalent text alternatives.
Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions.
Text and images with insufficient contrast between foreground and background color combinations.
Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not support the use of custom color combinations.
Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full keyboard support.



Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids.
Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions.

Visual
Enlarging or reducing text size and images;
Customizing settings for fonts, colors, and spacing;
Listening to text-to-speech synthesis of the content;
Listening to audio descriptions of video in multimedia;
Reading text using refreshable Braille.


For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to ensure that the 
""presentation of web content is independent of its underlying structure"" and 
that the structure is correctly coded so that it can be processed and presented 
in different ways by web browsers and assistive technologies. For example, 
some people do not see the content and rely on lists, headings, tables, and 
other page structures to be properly coded so that they can be identified 
by web browsers and assistive technologies.



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all.

//Keyboard compatibility:
All functionality must be usable with the keyboard. That is, users can access 
and move between links, buttons, forms, and other controls using the Tab key 
and other keystrokes. Websites should not require a mouse; for example, pop-up 
calendars should also let users type in a date.

Ensure that the tab order is logical, to allow keyboard navigation around the 
content and controls. Provide a way for users to jump between blocks of content 
and controls.

//Video/animation Captions:


//Colors with Good Contrast:
color contrast between text color and the background color
technically called luminance contrast ratio
this includes text on images, icons, and buttons.

Also colors used to convey information on diagrams, maps, and other types of 
images must be distinguishable.


What are the additional benefits?
Content works in different lighting conditions, such as sunlight and glare.
Content is easier to read by everyone, including those who do not have specific visual conditions.

Select text and background colors that provide sufficient contrast. 
There are tools to help check and select appropriate color combinations. 
This is ideally done during the early design stage and the selection of 
color palettes. While some people need high contrast, some people are 
sensitive to brightness and need to change the colors.

important enough to be seen and needs to be clear

//customizable text:
Some users need to be able to change the way text is displayed so that they 
can read the text. This includes changing the size, spacing, font, color, and 
other text properties. When users change these properties, no information or 
functionality should be lost, and the text should re-flow so users don’t have 
to scroll horizontally to read sentences. Text customization is more than the 
zoom functionality, which only changes the text size.

Content is more adaptable to smaller and larger screen sizes.
Content is more adaptable when translated, since words and sentences are 
different lengths in different languages.

Content must be properly designed and coded so that it can adapt to different 
customization settings. This includes using relative rather than absolute units 
for the size of fonts, controls, and other objects. Applications should use the 
operating system and web browser text settings. Websites and applications could 
also provide information to help users change their settings

//Clear Layout and Design:
The different parts of a web page must be easy to locate and identify. 
This includes navigation menus, links, and text sections. 
These should be at predictable locations and consistently identified. 
Also form labels and instructions have to be clearly associated with their controls.

Content is more usable for people who are new to the particular website or application.
Content is more usable for mobile device users who are seeing it on smaller screens, 
especially if they are in a hurry or distracted.
Content and functionality is easier to locate and identify by most users.

Design clear structure, both visually and through the markup. For example, 
make it easy to distinguish sections such as navigation, group related controls 
in a form, and provide headers to identify groups of information. 
Provide consistent presentation and behavior of web pages across a website.


//Speech recognition
Speech recognition can be used for dictating text in a form field, as well as 
navigating to and activating links, buttons, and other controls. 
Most computers and mobile devices today have built-in speech recognition 
functionality. Some speech recognition tools allow complete control over computer 
interaction, allowing users to scroll the screen, copy and paste text, activate 
menus, and perform other functions.

Content must be properly designed and coded so that it can be controlled by speech. 
"keyboard compatibility" is the basis for such coding. In addition, labels and 
identifiers for controls in the source code need to match their 
visual presentation, so that it is clear which speech command will activate 
a control.


//text to speech
 Screen readers provide important functionality such as navigating through headings, 
 speaking image alternatives, and identifying internal and external links. 
 They can also highlight the text as it is being read aloud for people to see 
 and hear the content at the same time. Content must be coded properly so that 
 all of the functionality of the text-to-speech software works with the content.

Content can be read aloud for people

Use semantic HTML markup for structures such as headings, paragraphs, lists, forms, 
and tables. Provide text alternatives for images, icons, and other non-text content. 
Ensure keyboard compatibility, and ensure that text information is understandable 
without the visual context.


//understandable content
Content must be easy to follow and understand for many users. For most content, 
this means simply avoiding overly complex sentences and jargon, and providing 
clear layout and design. For some complex content such as medical information, 
separate, easy-to-read information may be necessary.

Provide structure using headings, lists, and spacing.
Provide illustrations that clarify the content, when helpful.
Provide clear layout and design with consistent orientation and navigation cues.


//Large Links, Buttons, and Controls:
The area for clicking and tapping controls must be large enough for people to 
activate them. This includes links, buttons, checkboxes, and other controls. 

Small controls, and controls that are placed too close to each other, 
are difficult for many people to use.

Content is more usable on touch screens, especially on smaller mobile devices.
Content is more usable in situations where the device cannot be held steady.

Design large controls or activation areas around the controls. (Increasing the 
font size of the control sometimes isn’t enough.) Provide adequate separation 
between selectable controls. Provide labels for controls, which enlarges the 
activation area in many browsers because the label for checkboxes and option 
buttons is also clickable.


//Notifications and Feedback
For example, users need confirmation messages when actions are completed, 
such as when forms are submitted. Also, error messages must provide clear directions 
rather than confuse users.

Content is less confusing and daunting to everyone, regardless of skills.

At least one billion people – 15% of the world’s population – have a recognized disability15

Accessible design considerations often lead to improvements in general 
customer experience and loyalty.

all over the world, governments and regulators began to mandate laws and policies 
that strengthen the rights of people with disabilities to participate in online 
digital information and services.

The website must be made accessible to “individuals with disabilities 
who use computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.”
